Forrestal,2070,"Brief Question here from someone that is interested. 

SpaceX's current strategy revolves mostly around old style Rockets, even if they are now approaching complete reusability (Grasshopper rocks). Has SpaceX looked into Hybrid craft like the SABRE program happening in the UK, or look into the possibility of a space elevator (Even at a thought experiment stage) in the way that Google and NASA have done?

We can bring it back to the launch site, but the boost back penalty is significant. If we also have to the plane change for geo missions from Cape inclination (28.5 deg) to equatorial, then a downrange platform landing is needed. **2.** The Mars transport system will be a completely new architecture. Am hoping to present that towards the end of this year. Good thing we didn't do it sooner, as we have learned a huge amount from Falcon and Dragon. **3.**Our spacesuit design is finally coming together and will also be unveiled later this year.

32no,420,"Hi Elon,

Although you asked for the AMA to be focused on the SpaceX launch, the Tesla fanbase has some questions that are yet to be answered. Although I have a lot of questions, I limited myself to 4 brief questions:

1.  How significant is Tesla's technology in the battery cell and pack? (some believe that Tesla just spot welds Panasonic 18650 cells and wraps it into a pack, which means that any other company can partner with Panasonic and make similar batteries)

2. Assuming that external market conditions are not prohibitive, what automobile strategy would you prefer Tesla Motors to follow in order to achieve the stated goal of electrifying the car market:
	* A. Mass market auto manufacturer (Toyota)
	* B. Premium Auto manufacturer (BMW), developer and manufacturer of electric drive trains for other automobile companies
	* C. Premium Auto manufacturer (BMW), developer of electric drive trains, licensing this 	technology to other auto manufacturers.

The next two questions will be Tesla investor related, since analysts sometimes ask the wrong questions during quarterly calls:

3. While the Gigafactory is supposed to cut battery costs by 30% before the Model 3 is released in 2017, how much further will Tesla cut battery costs by 2020?

4. What operating margin does Tesla aim for in the 2020 time frame, when Tesla will be producing 500,000 vehicles per year?


**EDIT:** If you cannot answer any Tesla investor specific questions, could you at least answer the first two? Also, I saw another question I liked: When are you going to do a blog post that compares well-to-wheels carbon emissions of electric battery cars, gasoline cars, and fuel cell cars?

secondlamp,24,"Hello Mr. Musk,

I actually have a couple questions. Feel free to answer any number of those:

* You stated, that you expect that all earth-based transport will eventually become electric. You with Tesla pushing cars, motorcycles happening by itself (Zero Motorcycles, Brammo, and 1000+ others in China) and planes needing a couple of iterations in battery chemistry, I was thinking about ships. And I think that container ships would be worth a thought or two, because there are already cranes in place that would allow battery swapping, if one packaged the batteries in standard 20’ or 40’ containers.  
The actual question I want to ask is:  
Can you give me more accurate numbers regarding the energy density (Wh/kg as well as Wh/L), power per kg, (dis)charge-efficiency and heat output as most sources don’t look at it at the pack level but at the cell level (leaving out cooling systems, etc.).  
I threw a quick spreadsheet together with some (very) rough estimations [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FO_vYrolUu0563Beysme3rUP_8Qwg53oo2eoMu1wvq4/edit#gid=0) for those interested and for others thatknow better than me to correct my errors.

* A friend of mine and I had a discussion about [power-to-gas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_to_gas#Power_to_gas_.E2.80.93methane), where electricity is converted into methane (Sabatier-process) and fed into the existing natural gas grid, not only to cover needs for natural gas (heating of homes, not easily converted) but as a means of storage (reconvert into electricity when needed). And we came to the conclusion that power-to-gas would be cheaper (the increased efficiency of batteries does not seem to make up their high cost, even after 30% cost reduction w/ the Gigafactory). Can you comment on that? Do I have wrong numbers?

* As far as I know the engines on the Falcon 9 can only throttle down to 60%. Maybe I’m completely wrong with this and some equation dictates that a rocket engine cannot throttle below a certain threshold, whatever the configuration is. But I was wondering if it’s possible to do pulse-width-modulation? Like throttle somewhere 100%-60% then shut it down and back up before the turbopump stops (idk how inertia the pump has. assuming the whole thing is 70kg, probably not much). Maybe if you hit a certain frequency the system resonates and it works well.

* And lastly if it were time to choose the actual place for the first martian settlement where would you put it?

Thank you for your time, and good luck for the CRS-5 barge landing!

I have many short questions regarding future Tesla production and program.

1.) Will there be any reasonable price drop within the next ~20 years that you are anticipating?


2.) Using graphene super capacitors for your cars would push so many envelopes and entirely change the dynamic of entire industries. Do you think research in this area to mass produce it would be useful? I believe Samsung put a patent out for mass production of graphene super capacitors, so there is progress in the field indeed.

3.) How many more iterations of Teslas do you want to see?

rudyard_blue,2,"What's your thought on an ion engine powered by capacitors or batteries. Could you generate enough thrust to have the capsule return to earth, instead of using chemical thrust. Also at some point in time chemical rockets will make no sense in bringing the material needed to get to mars (cost) due to the energy and money required to make regular escape velocities from earth and from mars. A rail gun would make sense short term followed by a space elevator. Do you agree? A space elevator would also be used to supply Earth or Mars with the need material from space to supply our exponential population growth, both on Mars and Earth. I'll take Venus over Mars and with a space elevator, the right permeable membrane, vacuum, and a little atmosphere electric potential will be able to convert the air in no time. Why we don't build such a device for Earth baffles me. Could get pure Carbon out of the air no problem.

Hi Elon, in the 1980s, my father & his colleagues at Boeing worked on the idea of meeting the nation's energy needs by putting large arrays of solar panels into geosynchronous orbit, and beaming the power back to Earth by microwaves. It was obvious that getting the cost of getting materials & personnel into orbit WAY down was key to making this concept work.

spinoza844,2,"Hey Elon thanks for doing this! 
So I have to say, I am a bit skeptical of electric cars. I really really want to believe in them but one thing that always seems to be the Achilles heel is the cost of that battery. 

I read an article in the [Wall Street Journal] (http://www.wsj.com/news/article_email/SB10001424052702304157204579473304005412522-lMyQjAxMTA0MDAwMjEwNDIyWj) that seemed to estimate the cost of the Tesla battery cost per kWh at 250-300 dollars (which is the wholesale price btw, so I presume Tesla marks up that cost for the consumer). As I think it mentioned there this in itself is greater than the cost of most standard cars and of course for range that is not even equivalent to my 1996 Camry clunker. 

Considering that present batteries lose efficiency and will have to be replaced at some point in the lifetime of the car, it seems that electric cars have a difficult hurdle to overcome. Even with the promised 30% drop in cost as a result of the Giga factory, I find it hard to believe that the batteries will come down to a truly affordable level for anytime soon. 

So I guess my long winded question is how do you think the battery price problem will be cracked? And at what point can we start expecting to see battery prices be at a level that is acceptable for the mass market? 

Thanks so much!"

Some questions for you,

1) What's the focus of SpaceX, as a near term goal a lot of people think of the MCT, but once that's been accomplished and a colony forms on Mars, where do you plan on taking SpaceX next?

2) Has SpaceX been investigating alternatives beyond chemical based propulsion for interplanetary travel?

3) What will SpaceX be breaking the $1,000/kg barrier to orbit with and how far off do you think we are from that point?  What do you think the key enabler will be? Resuability, SSTO,  automated production, ...?

I hope to be working with yall in the near future at SpaceX, I'm working on my masters degree otherwise I'd already be on the team.

FH will only carry 50ish tons fully expended, so it seems like there's a gap of at least 100 tons where FH is too small and BFR too big. Maybe a version of FH with 4-6 boosters?

I know it's premature to the point of being meaningless -- at this point the prerequisite steps of advancing space exploration technology are identical regardless of whether Mars or Venus were the destination -- but have you put any serious thought into weighing the pros and cons of high altitude Venusian exploration or even colonization vs. colonization of Mars as a first big step towards becoming an interplanetary species? 

I watched a lecture you gave in 2012 where someone asked you this in Q&A and you laughed at the question, but seemed to think he was asking about possible colonization of the *surface* of Venus which, in all fairness, is laughable. It lead me to think that, as of 2012, you were unfamiliar with the concept.

Quick run down of the advantages colonizing of Venus at an altitude of 50km:

* Breathable air is a lifting gas 50% as powerful as Helium is at sea level on Earth.

* Temperatures from 0 - 50 Celsius. 

* About 90% of Earth's gravity.

* Air pressure at about 1 bar. (No explosive depressurization and no pressurized spacesuits necessary)

* Radiation shielding from atmosphere.

* Hydrogen and oxygen available in the atmosphere in the form of sulfuric acid (yeah, I might be polishing a turd here, but it's still worth mentioning).

* Shorter transit time between Venus and Earth than Mars and Earth with more frequent launch windows.

* Better vantage point for spotting near-Earth objects otherwise obscured by the sun's glare. 

I hope you get to this question, but regardless, thank you very much for the great work you are doing. I wish you all the success in the world, and whatever other planet you set your sights on.

My question concerns the adoption of electric vehicles in the US:

It always seemed to me that a big hinderance to widespread adoption of electric vehicles was the lack of a sufficient charging infrastructure.  The lack of infrastructure is due to people not buying electric cars.

So people aren't buying cars cause they can't reliably charge them, and people/businesses aren't installing chargers because there aren't enough electric cars around to merit their installation.

More of a technical question: I know that the Merlin engines run off of RP-1 and LOX. Is there any additional measures you plan on using for future iterations of those engines, such as film cooling in addition to regenerative cooling (similar to an M1D but with exhaust from the gas turbine being ported around the exit of the nozzle) in order to cool the nozzle more? Its been used on a lot of the larger Russian rockets and seems to be an efficient use of exhaust of the gas turbine since the engine could be throttled more (having the nozzle at a lower temperature due to the film cooling) rather than just blowing it out separately from the nozzle.

I'm a high school student (who also happens to be a KSP player) and I'm wondering: how do you believe the weaponization of space will affect commercial space ventures? Will SpaceX pitch in to make more money off of military contracts, or are you morally against such ventures?

This next question is relevant if you do intend on bidding for defense contracts. (Such as putting up an orbital kinetic bombardment system, or even a processing facility to refine asteroid ore into tungsten rods)

I understand SpaceX hasn't been too friendly with the ULA, but do you believe the Pentagon will eventually favor SpaceX over the ULA for military payloads, or is the military bureaucracy too stagnant (akin to molasses, perhaps? :) ) to accept a new primary launch provider?

[QUESTION] - Has Tesla Motors considered moving into the public transport sector, primarily buses?

As if you think about it, public transport buses take up a huge section of overall carbon emissions on a given year (along with cargo trucks) & they also have a very large surface area which could provide a decent amount of solar panels.

Furthermore,

Buses are usually in direct sunlight most of the day & are stored in large open parking lots at the beginning & end of each day with usually nothing to obstruct the sunlight from getting to the rooftops of a bus.

You could also provide both superchargers at these bus parking lots & perhaps even work out a deal with city council to reserve at least say 20% of the overall bus surface area for Tesla Motors advertising, while the rest remains reserved for 3rd-parties :)


I hope this finds it way to you Elon Musk & I am looking forward to what 2015 brings from you, Tesla Motors, SpaceX, SolarCity & The Hyperloop :D

Have you ever thought of investing time into the development and research of commercial drones/multiorotors and the endless possibilities for their use cases in numerous industries?  

Your accomplishments are truly amazing, and give hope to people like myself starting small with a big dream for my remote aerial imaging company cinemaflight.com, and my multimedia production company digitalmastermedia.com

Reading about what you've achieved, and how young you were is part of what inspired me to make drastic changes in my life not too long ago. I could only afford community college and shortly after 2 years I felt that the money I was spending on loans honestly was not going to good use. I learned more online and by going to Barnes & Noble or the library. I decided to drop out of college and begin using that money towards building my business. Since childhood I have always loved aviation and the thought of flight so the hobby of rc aviation quickly became on of my favorites. I made it my goal to take my hobby aviation flying & design skills and create a plausible service to offer as a company. I have relied upon the internet and books to learn many skills ranging from photography, video production, website design, computer science, and electronics to have the capabilities myself to begin my own business from the ground up. I now provide and produce high quality aerial video and photography utilizing drones that I custom build for safety, and long flight times. Taking learning into my own hands was honestly my best decision ever, that's not to say I haven't had some trial and error though. I began my company Cinemaflight.com in 2014 and since then I have acquired numerous clients though it has been rough attempting to grow and scale when the FAA is currently undecided in regards to the regulations that may be set in place. 

Can you provide any advice, thoughts or recommendations for steps that I should take to grow my business? I have been trying everything I can on my own to market within numerous industries though I feel that I always hit a wall when it comes to getting in contact with company owners and decision makers. I recently met with a millionaire investor that said he sees potential for turning my company cinemaflight into a franchise service provider for the real estate industry. He said that I have good skills, but so do 1 million other people. What makes you unique is that you have the drive and willingness to continue to reach out and seek new business opportunities no matter what it takes. He also mentioned that the reason I am hitting a wall in regards to marketing to owners of big companies is because they honestly receive 1000's of  inquiries and you need someone who has high level contacts that can get your foot in the door with the right people. I had a few business meetings so far though I need to figure out exactly what working with him would entail, I see potential for Cinemaflight.com and dont plan on giving up any ownership unless I truly know it is with a reputable company or mentor that can help me grow. Can you provide any advice in regards to meeting with investors? It was the first time I had ever had a high level meeting with someone so successful and it was a bit overwhelming lol. He gave me a expensive cigar (I Dont Usually Smoke) I got extremely sick and threw up on my way home, though fortunately we had a great meeting and he was able to give me great business advice. My plans for 2015 are to do whatever I can to continue to grow my business and become successful. Any advice you can give me is truly appreciated and I hope that you can be of help.

However, as someone who likes some of these companies and doesn't necessarily like what they become, i feel like this actually causes harm as the quality of the product often diminishes greatly. Do you feel the same way? I notice you seem to have no intent on selling SpaceX, Tesla, etc. Similarly, i notice a lot of tech people today absolutely abhor the idea of producing hardware (Apple excepted) and will do anything to avoid it, including using cheap contracted hardware that does nobody any good. Again, i see you doing the opposite and doing ""traditional"" hardware/production companies. Do you have any words of wisdom on that front?

Secondly, oil has become quite volatile recently and is seeing a steep dive. While this is likely good for SpaceX, i imagine people are less interested in Teslas if they can get $2/gal gas. Do you have any plans for navigating the near future for Tesla? (Or do you even need plans?)"

PreludesAndNocturnes,1,"Hey Elon!

Over the years there have been countless comparisons between you and Marvel's Tony Stark character, and you obviously don't mind such comparisons given your hilarious cameo in Iron Man 2. 

I think the most significant similarity with the character is that you're the business mogul **and the engineer**. Just like Stark, you aren't just a savvy CEO who sits on his laurels and lets the *nerds* do all the ""science-y"" work. You like to get your hands dirty, and whether it's software, automotive engineering, or friggin' rocket scientist, you balance the business decisions, while also working on the technical side of things. 

Do you credit your ongoing success from your embracement of both sides of the coin? Have you ever met a CEO of another company and been shocked by their technical ignorance of their product? Do you think that other companies would benefit from marrying business and technical roles more smoothly such as with your companies? Do you have any advice for entrepreneurs who want to juggle working on both the technical side and the business side?

Couple Tesla Questions for you.  It seems that the Tesla owners community has two main concerns that come up and I'm wonder if there is anything you can comment on how/if these issues may be addressed.

The first is repair cost.  It seems that its very easy for insurance companies to just total out a vehicle for what is relatively minor damage.  Is there any effort being made to bring repair costs down?  

The second is communication issues.  It seems like there are times when communication is not being sent down to the employees at the sales and delivery level. So blog updates of ""rear doors now open wider"" are left  up to owners to actually document the changes, when asking an employee of Tesla is that they do not know the specifics.   Other issues seem that features roll out and its a surprise to both staff and the person receiving the car what they are or are not.  Please tell me that there is a plan to improve communication on the front end of buying a Tesla to match the wonderful experience of owning a Tesla.

"
SinfulSoul4000,1,"Hi Mr. Musk. Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA. I have two questions for you; one about fuel for rockets and one about batteries.

1. In regards to fuel for rockets. I know you've talked about using Methane in the future instead of the current rocket fuel that everyone uses. I understand that weight of the propellant itself is one of the problems to deal with when thinking about adding more fuel. To a layman on this subject, can you explain why Methane is superior as opposed to lighter elements like Hydrogen or some other gaseous/liquid/hybrid element lower on the periodic table? 

2. I want to dig back to the Boeing battery problem that we saw on a pack that overheated (Exploded? Caught fire?) I think in 2013. You had offered to help in finding a solution and suggested significantly reducing the size and shape of the batteries to reduce the amount of heat build up in each individual cell. As I recall they did not take this advice and instead implemented a system that managed cooling the batteries, I guess better than they did before. I remember you've mentioned that small radius circular batteries such as the standardized NCR18650A are better at dispersing heat and carry less risk if one cell fails. At the same time I've heard you in other interviews say that you want to eventually increase the size slightly. What economic and/or engineering advantages are gained by slightly increasing size, but don't create economies of scale problems by going non-standard or add the additional risks we saw in the Boeing example? ...Also are Boeing planes safe?

almost one and a half years later though, it seems that no larger transportation company has seriously picked up the idea or made plans to implement the technology (or at least none have stated so publicly).

my questions:

1. does the reception sort of meet your expectations?

Two questions:

1) A stated goal of your other awesome company is to allow consumers to reduce their reliance on oil for transportation in favor of other energy sources that don’t contribute as much to climate change (natural gas, nuclear, solar, etc.).  Given that spent rocket fuel pollutes much more per unit than oil products, and that it pollutes the upper atmosphere in unique and significant ways (e.g., releasing 1000X the amount of soot per unit burned than jet fuel), what can and should be done to help the space industry make similar strides away from climate-change-causing propellants?

I am a strong advocate for the advancement of human space exploration, and my fascination with space and space travel has shaped my education -- I recently finished applying to several Astrophysics/Astronomy PhD programs. My dream job is to one day work with SpaceX.

My question is: Does SpaceX hire Astrophysicists? And if so, do you have any advice to help improve my chances? I believe (and have been told) I have a solid resume for only being 20 years old, but I always feel that I will not have done enough to have the privilege of working with SpaceX.

Thank you very much for your time to do this AMA. We all know how incredibly busy you are.
I have watched every single SpaceX launch for the past two years, and I will most certainly be watching the launch tomorrow morning. Best of luck with landing the rocket and once again paving the way for advancement in spaceflight!"

I have been a fan of your approach, although a lot of the times the science escapes me.

I wanted to ask if your future Tesla plans involve making affordable (sub $20k) long range (greater than 200 mile) electric cars? I think the only thing stopping me from putting down money on an electric car is the price and the range.

I'm not too well read on the subject, but what are the benefits of a railway over the proposed Evacuated Tube Transport Technology (ET3) system?

cclementi6,1,"Hello Mr. Musk! Ever since I first heard of it back when the Roadster was still in production, Tesla has always been the company/car of my dreams.  It inspires me to see how far it's come today.  

You always talk about how your goal for Tesla is to push the rest of the auto industry towards the direction Tesla is going, towards fully electric vehicles.  You always express gladness, not contempt or competitiveness, when you talk about other manufacturers producing (or attempting to produce) cars to match or beat the Model S.  The public release of Tesla's patents was evidence enough of this.

While this is inspiring and awesome, I nevertheless find it a bit hard to believe considering Tesla still is a business and should be run like one, not a NGO or something.  Is competition really not a concern?  If another major car company released an affordable electric vehicle that could match up in performance to the Model S, wouldn't you be worried at all for Tesla?"

I was curious what your reaction was to Lockheed-Martin publicly proclaiming, they are five to ten years away from a small cold fusion device, that will essentially perform the same function as the ITER Tokamak on a much smaller scale.

There have been a lot of videos of the P85D racing supercars lately, like [this one](http://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/tesla-model-s-p85d-races-lamborghini-aventador/) of the D barely losing to an Aventador and [this one](http://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/tesla-p85d-races-ferrari-550-video/) of it smashing a Ferrari 550. 

Obviously street racing is bad m'kay, but what do you think these races mean for the supercar industry? Was the P85D, one of the most mainstream performance EVs out there, needed to get purists to accept electrics?

First off, let me say I'm a huge fan. Your success is great motivation for me to push myself to succeed.

* As a college student about to finish my aerospace engineering degree, how would you suggest I make myself stand out to companies like yours along with others? Thus far, it seems like everyone I know that has found internship work and resulting full time work was because they knew someone at the company they worked for. I unfortunately don't have any such connections and find it very difficult to make progress with applications.

* Second, is there any likelihood/possibility of you creating or expanding a current company of yours to also include aircraft? It seems like the basic design of aircraft hasn't changed much for decades (to be fair, it has improved and become much more efficient).

No one seems to talk much about the politics surrounding a Mars colony. What rights or privileges do the first people on Mars have over others? What governance do they follow? If SpaceX lands people on Mars, who is in control on the ground and who decides some of the larger issues regarding the colony? Will the US government legislate Mars residents? If later another country (either public organization or private) lands people, are there 2 governments in play now or are those on Mars autonomous? How will land claims be handled?"

You've done phenomenal things with destabilizing the status-quo that so many other car manufacturers have sat behind for years. You've dared to stare them in face, challenge them, and not only beat them, but far exceed any expectations they and everyone else ever said you'd be able to do. There's one core goal that's so prevalent in everything you do, that I think you're a better role-model for children than any athlete, film star, politician, musician, or any other kind of celebrity could ever be. And that's because of your core motivation for why you do everything that you do.

You want to further development of clean energy. You want to speed up the race to Mars. You want to single handily create a market of business where the focus isn't to make more money to sit on for a rainy day, but to spark growth and affect trends towards the inevitable future when oil will be a thing of the past.

You want to help humanity, and you're not focused on the right now so much as you're focused on the grander scheme of things to come. You're amazing, please keep up the phenomenal work in everything that you do, I can only imagine what else lies in years to come.

He Earth however is a rather wonderful place but unsustainable development has been destroying much of our natural resources, damage to the atmosphere and water sourses and shortages of resources has caused poverty, conflict and wars. I have worked for decades in renewable energy and environmental solutions. The alternatives for sustainably producing energy, providing clean water, organic Perma culture food, safe effective housing and transportation have been developed and,are constantly being improved. However the existing powers don't really seem to want alternatives to pollution and profiteering to succeed. Whenever there is mention of the value of other ways of meeting the needs of the people without corporate centralized systems all types of negative statements are made. I just saw several proponents of nuclear energy mention the ""extremely toxic"" compounds released by the production of solar cells. 
What I have envisioned to demonstrate the many ways that the diverse technologies of providing for the needs of a growing population by using:the many types of solar energy: PV, concentrated thermal electric, solar water purrification, industrial, comnercial, residential thermal. Wind, Geothermal, small hydro, and conversion  of waste to energy. These energy systems combined with green agriculture, superefficient structures that are built with natural materials including earth and sustainable lumber, along with electric transportation, and water and waste management systems could provide the basis for a sustainable city demonstration project, educational Institute and World Exposition of what sustainable living looks like. 3 Million Dollars can buy a thousand acres of land near the Salton Sea and for the cost of producing a science fiction movie we could begin to build a city that will show the world how we can not only survive but thrive.

I have several questions, if I may: First, Tesla is an awesome company which has a lot of manufacturing here in the United States (such as your slated battery production facility in Nevada); why can't your lawyers, representatives, and spokespeople at the various state levels use that argument to counter the Car Dealership lobbies' efforts to block direct Tesla sales? Are you all working on some kind of PR counter to put public pressure upon governors and state legislatures? Don't you think that the majority of voters in any given state are unaware of the influence these car dealers have on their state lobbies and be a source of grassroots support for Tesla dealerships? Finally, the projected price of the Tesla roadster at $30k seems like a great deal, especially as you push batteries to have a 400+ mile range; are you sacrificing any performance or other bells & whistles for this entry-level model?"

None,1,"Hello Mr. Musk! I'm currently a high school student (10th grade) in the rocketry club at my school. We build and launch small rockets for barious purposes. One of our projects is Student Launch (SL). SL is a program run by NASA which involves teams of high school and university students designing rockets and flying scientific payloads in them. The program had been run for many years, but last year it was cancelled due to budget cuts to NASA's outreach program. This year, it's back. However in previous years, NASA funded the construction of the rockets, while this year they are not.

This brings me to my question for you. Do you think that the general public is losing interest in space exploration? If so, what do you think should be done to raise awareness towards it? How can we show people that space is worth exploring?"

After an unfortunate event, and surely after the Civil war, there was no ambition for students to research rocketry.
Which is sad for a country that has known 15 years of war, to let go of that small intellectual flame it had.

SavvyGent,1,"Hi Elon, thank you for taking the time to do this AMA!

SpaceX keeps me excited about the future, and Tesla provides me a dream of one day owning a Model S, so needless to say that your work often makes my day better. Heck, I even check for supercharger updates regularly. I think this applies to many people, but for most of us, owning a Model S is out of reach for the forseeable future. Therefore, I have an idea that I would like to share with you, but before I do, I just want to thank you for all that you are doing - in case you start to tune out during my rambling!

I know it’s a dream for many people, all over the world, to go to the US and drive across country, it has been one of mine for as long as I can remember. It has now been made even more relevant for me, because my sister, her husband and kids (with a new one on the way) have recently moved to the states. So it seems to me that you could make a lot of dreams come true, while benefitting Tesla, if you were to set aside a few Model S’ that people could rent and drive from New York to Los Angeles. Besides making dreams come true, it would test the Model S’ long term endurance and prove the supercharger network beyond any doubt, and also provide great PR on social media when people come home and have a story to tell about the trip of a lifetime.
If you could make this happen to someone whose annual income is a tenth of the price of a Model S, I would be very grateful!

This comment sort of lacks a question, so I have one of those as well: I am very much looking forward to the attempted barge landing and future similar events, so could you talk a little about how much of those events you are willing to share with the world on video or livestreams?

Carl Sagan used to talk enthusiastically about the merits of nuclear pulse propulsion. It seems like the best idea we have to get across the solar system in reasonable timeframes.

I'm sure that you've looked into Project Orion in the past. What are your thoughts on developing spaceships that utilize this form of propulsion?

First of all, I want to say you are a very big inspiration to me and I think you do amazing work. I was wondering about SpaceX and what your ultimate goal for the company is. I know you're working on rockets that can re-land themselves but I am curious if you have any plans to create actual futuristic space ships that can just leave and enter planets with ease. Furthermore, do you have any ideas on creating some sort of colony on Mars? That would be super interesting although the calendar would be all different and I day would be more than 24 hours which might be kind of confusing :/

chrisv650,1,"Say I know a way of selling a lot of Tesla cars very quickly - would this be useful to you or are you limited by production rather than sales?

I live in Oxford, UK and we are surrounded by business parks full of hundreds of tech firms.  Given the benefits of having a Tesla as a company car in the UK (£5k government grant, benefit in kind advantages etc) and how attractive they are especially to the market sector of people working for tech firms, which is a huge potential market in the UK.

What I'd love to do is hold arranged visits to these companies and business parks to allow the employees to come and see the car before or after work and during their lunch break.  Ideally you'd want to give people a quick ride around the area (passenger seat only!)

The whole goal would be to generate desire for a test drive and therefore leads for the sales team in London.

Obviously this would only actually help if the current production set up is going to be generating a surplus any time soon - hopefully it is!

I've put together a full presentation on the idea so won't bore you with any more details as I'm sure you've got a lot of questions to answer, is there a good person in the Tesla Motors organisation to approach with it?

I really enjoy space and exploration and creating cool new things that might be up there one day and I'm still pretty young so I think I can take chances.

FH will only carry 50ish tons fully expended, so it seems like theres a gap of at least 100 tons where FH is too small and BFR too big. Maybe a version of FH with 4-6 boosters? Or is there just not enough of a market predicted for payloads that big outside of your own Mars missions, so they'd just fly on BFR anyway?"

As big as your impact has and will be in energy and space transport, IMO your biggest impact will be inspiring my generation and future generations to dream HUGE and tackle big hairy issues. You are history's greatest beacon for this movement.

Of your 5 causes that will most affect the future of humanity, I believe AI will be the biggest but also the most dangerous. Would you suggest that young ambitious adults like myself try to keep AI on the tracks in the form of entrepreneurship (as you have done in your fields), or is an alternative route like academia or government more effective given the risk?

Huge fan. I test drove a Model S and am totally converted. The elegant simplicity of the electronic components shown in the showroom of a chassis without the body was the most surprising. It really sets it apart from other EV or hybrid cars. I imagine there will be a robust previously owned market in Teslas down the road with upgraded batteries since an older one would be close to new quality - unlike say a BMW M5, which would more show its age without increasingly expensive maintenance. While I love cars, I work in public transit and studied urban planning - for a number of reasons the world, and especially America, needs a more balanced transportation system and I think the dense, high quality of life, livable and walkable city is the future and incubator of innovation. A number of trends are pointing in that direction. Do you see the fantastic Tesla technology for elegant, simple and efficient design making its way into public transit vehicles and potentially automated buses that could work like Uber? Hyperloop is a bold idea, but I'm thinking more intraurban, local and being a game changer for those of lower income, the disabled and better urban mobility in general. "

Is there any plan to produce a no-frills, fun-to-drive, affordable, ""driver's car"" Tesla? Sort of a hot-hatch for the electric car world. Not to say existing Tesla's aren't fun to drive (I've never had the pleasure), but your average gearhead will take a stiff suspension and clever differential over a touchscreen any day, and a $90 000 car is a bit pricey. Or is this sort of the direction the 3 is headed?

On a somewhat related note, do you think we'll ever see an electric car with a multi-ratio gearbox? Or is it not worth the extra weight? I've never seen the torque curve for your motors so I don't know if it's peaky enough for multiple ratios to be worth it haha. Would it allow you to use a less powerful motor than the 300-odd bhp one in the Model S without hindering performance too much?

I live and work in The Black Hills of South Dakota.  We have a lot of Oil people here with all the shale oil exploration just North of us.  We also have pressure from Uranium mining firms who are pushing to extract Uranium in a way that threatens the Oglala aquifer that runs from The Black Hills to TX.  In order for electric cars to be successful on a global scale, will your company require power from nuclear plants, increasing the pressure to mine Uranium where I live?  I am not fond of oil and gas, but I'm also not fond of the idea of destroying the Oglala aquifer and all of the life it supports.  I know this is a rocket thread, but I don't want anyone to drink irradiated water so we can have electric cars.  We're trading one environmental calamity for another one.

I genuinely plan to name one of my sons after you, you've inspired so much of my success in business and life, and continue to inspire me in all of your new endeavors. Your attention to detail from big picture down to incremental strategy is breathtaking.

That being said I had a couple of entrepreneurial questions for you:

1. You've built businesses that require an incredible amount of fundamental processes, do you have any words of advice on keeping a better focus on process, and a general rule of thumb that you carry between businesses to scale quickly?

2. What are a few words that you keep in mind or that you think entrepreneurs should keep in mind while growing a business? Basically a mantra to repeat internally as you try to grow a team, increase revenue, and achieve your goals?

3. You've talked a lot about the different fundamental points that you believe we need to solve before becoming a truly sustainable species, are there any others that you can see your focus turning to at any point, as you seem close to achieving the few that you initially set out to solve.

Mr. Musk, 

Our company has been buying rockets from you for the past decade, but these space catapults are honestly cool as fuck.

Two questions, 1 future and 1 past.

How soon do you hope to have Teslas that are affordable to the average person?  I am looking forward to everything that Tesla does in terms of working to break our dependency on fossil fuels, but the base model is something like 2-3 times my yearly salary (pre-tax).

Huge Fan of everything you and your team's successes. 


I'm a big fan of Green energy and I have an idea that would revolutionize EV's, Cellphones, Space exploration, and energy production world wide. Never have to depend on Wind/Sun/Water to produce electricity. Just basic *overlooked physics.*

Just imagine where you plug in your Tesla Automobile to your house garage not to charge it but to power your own house, Space exploration to a plethora of planets and not just to Mars. 

I've told only one person about it but all I've gotten back every time I pitch the idea are *""it will never happen,""* *""The reason why nobody ever made that is because it will never work,""* *""You have no time and money to build one,""* and just all kinds of negative comments.

I have realized that the closest I might get to my dream, in my lifetime (provided we don't solve mortality with electronics), is to work for a space company. SpaceX seems like the logical and heartfelt choice on my part.

I'm very interested in your ability to see a massive problem and figure out how to solve it. From what I've gathered it seems like you took the biggest picture ideas you could imagine, like colonizing space, and revolutionizing the transportation industry and somehow understood the problem and designed the solution. Your productivity is inspiring and I would really love to know what keeps you moving. 

How, in the face of problems which no person has ever solved, are you able to learn so much so quickly, and on top of that, bring that knowledge to a tangible design? Could it be that you are extremely motivated by the problem? or the solution? When going out to solve this problem do you always have your eyes on the end result, while you are building up your foundations? or is the act of learning what gets you going? Really any comment about your motivations when tackling a large problem would be greatly appreciated.

1) The Model S is a wonderful electric car that, in my mind, almost doesn't look like an electric car (Same with what I've seen of the Model X, except those have the falcon doors). In your opinion, should other car companies who also produce electric cars (but obviously not at the Tesla price point) try to keep to more current-day designs instead of the awkward looking behemoth that is the Scion iQ and the Mitsubishi iMiev?

2) Keeping with the whole traditional car thing, at some point in time (be it near future or in a decade) would Tesla potentially produce a car that is still electric but not quite as luxorious as the Model S? Something more of a daily driver kind of a car, something that looks normal but still has the electric Tesla motors?

3) If you get people to Mars, would you eventually try sending a Tesla there as well in some way? Considering the high safety ranking of the Model S, could it be theoretically feasible to put a Model S into a secure cargo bay in a rocket and safely land it on Mars?

Also, you should play Kerbal Space Program if you haven't. See if rocket designs like the Falcon Heavy work in there."

After you accomplish what you intend to with SpaceX, will the education of future generations be a vital 'problem' for you to fix so as to beneficially alter the progress of future generations here on Earth?

I am just amazed at the power of the internet for me to get in touch with so many amazing and successful and intelligent individuals. 
A quick bio on me: I read a lot of books. on business, capital allocation, investing, psychology, risk/return, business management, Ive read a lot of articles on how to succeed, make money, etc. I have watched thousands of videos online. Many speeches, lectures, talks and documentaries of successful people (including a one hour one on yourself and your business journey which I found very fascinating) 
I dont know if youll ever see this. I have so many questions. 
Your journey was a risky one that I would have thought at first until I learned more about it (technically arguably not so much even financially since you were probably smart enough to do well no matter what)
1. ive graduated in a degree from a university and ive considered all the pathways I can take with this and I don't feel happy, passionate or would really enjoy it if I did. Ever since I heard what Warren Buffett has said on the topic I have delved deep into it. I might have to do some compromising in the short run to be financially stable but it's been tough finding a job in that area to begin with. (Got a degree in science) Do you have any advice for this?
2. Do you have advice for success? Life advice? 
3. What you did plowing everything (I dont know the exact numbers but it seems like almost everything) into Tesla was admirable and quite interesting. I'm starting to see similarities with special situations of concentration rather than diversification for success
4. I was literally just pondering SpaceX and the potential for solar-powered energy in space the other day. I was literally picturing what I would say to you about the potential and how you're company is probably the highest chance of doing this. Then I found the wikipedia on it and realized how little I knew. 
5. I find certain things about you very interesting. How you have very distinct interests such as enjoying to talk about rocket science on dates. I have had trouble often times because of my niche interests. Don't know if you have any suggestions on this
6. Is your memory really photographic? As in you can see a page in a book and just immediately recall it too? any advice for people like me with above average iq's with ambition? 
7. I really am struggling to figure out what I can do to that I can love and make a living too. I have to consider things like practicality, reality, competition, etc. I'm really trying to figure this out. I have a youtube on success and my readings right now: http://youtube.com/willyoulaugh

Miister152,1,"Hi Elon, I must admit that I don't follow your work fully understanding all of the science behind what you do, rather I purely admire all of your amazing products and services. With that disclaimer, I have a few questions to ask about your work.



In regards to Tesla Motors:

* How do you think the motor industry will respond to the rise of electric cars in the next five to ten years, especially considering some of the more infrastructure related growth required to support electric cars.

* The current response from the motor industry (at least in the United States) has seemed to be one of dismissal of your product, to the point that your product has been legally challenged in a few states regarding the way you sell your cars. How do you see the American motor industry changing to appreciate your product as an innovation towards the next step towards pure electric cars? 

*  Would you like more serious competition now from other companies for electric only cars, or would you prefer that your company set the standard for the next few years to give a baseline to what a practical electric car should be?



In regards to SpaceX

* How would securing military contracts from the US Air Force help benefit the company towards expanding human space exploration, and  exactly how hard has it been trying to get those contracts? [This article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/07/25/why-spacex-still-cant-launch-military-satellites-the-90s/) gives a rough idea to some of the reasons getting the contracts are difficult, but are there other hurdles that we might not be aware of?

* In your opinion, is competition for privatized space exploration, such as from Virgin Galatic, and others, a good thing for the future of space exploration? Also, do you see governments getting back into space exploration after they see success from private space exploration companies like Space X?

hootener,1,"Elon Musk, thanks for taking the time to do this! I have a question or two about the ergonomics/human factors design of the Dragon (particularly the V2) as human factors is a field I've dabbled in throughout my career. 

(Note: I'm not as up to snuff on my SpaceX knowledge as I should be, so I'm going primarily by the interior/cockpit images shown in [this article](http://arstechnica.com/science/2014/05/spacex-shows-off-dragon-v2-its-brand-new-manned-space-capsule/). Apologies if my questions are way off base).

**TL;DR: Why such heavy touch screen use on the V2?** 

I'm primarily curious about their use from the interaction perspective. You extolled the virtues of touch screens (or screens in general) best yourself in the linked article above: 

> ...you can configure the interface to have a wide range of controls and a wide range of feedback, and you can really have almost an infinite amount of information...

But what about touch screens for interaction? Particularly in a space environment? It seems like in such an environment principles like [shape coding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_coding) would be of utmost importance. 

To be clear, I'm not saying touch screens were a bad decision by any means, I don't know enough about aerospace ergonomics to have an opinion one way or the other. I'm more curious about what processes led to their selection for the Dragon V2 and if SpaceX has designed any crazy awesome stuff to leverage touch screens (as interaction devices) more effectively in space.

You are a major inspiration for the type of work I plan to do and am in the process of making happen once I pay off my silly loans.  Major fan!  I quite literally have adopted your attitude towards work in my life.  You are the innovator, while I view myself as a catalyst.

1) I know you're not a real estate expert, but here it goes.

To accomodate the growing population and energy crisis at hand, I feel we should be utilizing the vertical component of buildings.  We are limited to a surface area around the globe, so we should consider building ""up"" instead of ""out.""  My theoretical real estate would handle  most overcrowding and energy problems along with emphasizing reusable energy (the buildings would ideally be 70-80% self-sufficient).  These buildings would essentially have their own microeconomies.  I feel this is an untapped market and if I can't do it, someone else needs to.  Do you feel it would be easier for me (from a financial and legal perspective) to ""convert"" existing real estate to this setup?  Or should I consider getting contracting education, outsourcing the technical stuff (architects, civil engineers, etc), and setting up a ""Masdar City"" prototype in a suburb of, say, New York City?  Which do you feel would be a more successful route?   Essentially, should I remodel existing real estate or build fresh?

2) When starting up Tesla, I'm sure you ran into government regulations that hindered your progression.  Did you find yourself bending to the government's will?  Or did you seek to bend the regulations through lobbying, workarounds, etc.  I know my ideas and work will probably be met with skepticism and barriers, but if we are to survive as a species, we have to adjust the way we consume energy in our homes and businesses.  (At least for the next 30 years or until fusion energy is a reality.)

3) Do you feel I should attempt my real estate ideas outside the US, such as in Africa or Asia?  Would that be easier?  It might be more economical (from a cost perspective) to showcase my work outside the US, and then have it gain traction on a global scale, much like your work at Tesla started in the US and spread over the world.  Africa could benefit from such endeavors.

4) What's your favorite beer?  So I can get you one when I'm up there with you ;)

Again, I thank you for all you've done for our species.  Seriously.  One day I'll be up there with you, making a difference in this world.  Just give me a decade."

DidoAmerikaneca,1,"Hi Elon! 
 

**What are your thoughts on Tesla developing a Model S *Coupe*?** Is this something the company would consider? 
 

A ""Model S Coupe"" presents an awesome opportunity for Tesla. 
 

Tesla's flagship sedan is impressive and charming in a lot of ways, but it doesn't offer the satisfaction of ego or vanity that a luxurious grand touring coupe would offer. This market is mainly catered to by luxurious European companies like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Maserati. Currently, the sales of these vehicles present a small but significant market. Catering to this market would require a small production output in order to be enhance the exclusivity of the vehicle and ensure that customers' tastes are catered to. The starting price for vehicles in this market is around $90,000, which is quite far north from the Model S's starting price. 


Entering this market with a product designed with Tesla's attention to detail and reputation for satisfaction, would draw admiration to the company and allow for a higher starting price, thus larger profit margins, and require relatively low costs for development. Even if Tesla starts the Model S Coupe at $90,000, it would have a significantly higher profit margin due to the added value of status and exclusivity provided in the vehicle. I have not reviewed Tesla's development costs closely, but imagine Tesla can expect a profit of at least $15,000 more per vehicle, compared to the Model S. 
 

Financial costs for development would be relatively low as this model could be developed on top of the Model S platform, which has incredible qualities to build on. A differentiated front and rear designs would be optimal, though smaller changes that amount to a ""refresh"" could also suffice. Many body parts could be used directly from the Model S. With a similar size and weight, the car can be expected to have very similar driving dynamics which would reduce testing costs. The body can be optimized for similar aerodynamic flow to preserve dynamics and efficiency. A short cockpit and long hood should be considered in order to make it possible for Tesla to break another machine at the NHTSA.
 

Tesla has limited production capacity and is currently using all of it to feed demand for the Model S and upcoming Model X. It is important that Model X production is not affected due to customers' already extended wait times for delivery. But due to the small production run that a coupe would need, something like 2,000 units, would be a very small hit on Model S production and would increase weight times only slightly if spread out over the year. Additionally, due to the similarities in the architecture and parts used between the two vehicles, most parts of the Model S production wouldn't have to change what they're doing. Very few machines would have to be retooled or altered, which further reduces the cost of the endeavor to Tesla. All of this also reduces the risk of the project costing too much or failing, since there is less that can go wrong. Also, if the old Model S isn't a good fit, Tesla could also choose to develop this alongside the next generation Model S which would also offer similar reduced costs. 
 

Tesla would also get a boost to its reputation from producing the vehicle. Tesla has captured the attention of the media and the public by repeatedly achieving impressively ambitious goals. As this vehicle would the the ""halo car"" of the brand, it could be an opportunity for Tesla to showcase the incredible products and technologies it is capable of creating. This would retain the attention of fans and continue to generate a lot of positive press. Tesla has saved millions on branding by spending almost no revenue on advertising and this would allow it to solidify its brand. Furthermore, when Tesla gets good press and attention, it finds that the government is more eager to work with it, as it saw during its negotiations for building the Gigafactory. 

**The Model S Coupe would increase profit margins, require limited costs and risks, and solidify Tesla's reputation in the market.**
 

I understand that Tesla is currently focused on bringing a mass market electric car to market - the Model III. But considerable profits can provide greater stability for Tesla to take risks on the Model III and make it truly great! 
 

It could be called the *Model M*.

My question to you is around how you feel about the way our US Government is run. Especially around the protest you filed around the closed bidding for Defense contracts.

I'm not sure where I saw it, but you were literally tearing up in your eyes when you talked about how some of your childhood heroes in space seemed to have turned against your company and the advancement of actual science due to their capital interests and greed.

Now that SpaceX has won DoD contracts for launches, do you feel the situation has improved? What would your ideal Government look like? 

Since ""ideal"" is an idea that will perpetually be at arm's length, what immediate small steps would you like our government to take so that we are moving in the right direction towards that ideal?

EDIT: Here's that vid: http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7402185n I have to admit, I may have made my own assumptions about greed playing a part in their opposition, and not just a simple case of not trusting in your capacity."

I've also seen few people being successful without any or some DISCIPLINE.

fatterSurfer,1,"Elon, excited to see the launch tomorrow and here's to hoping for a safe 1st-stage recovery. I've three unrelated questions:

1. You've commented that all modes of transportation (except rockets) will eventually need to transition to electric power. I'm with you up until air travel; are you envisioning fundamentally different battery technology? I just don't see batteries, as we know them today, achieving specific or volumetric energy densities sufficient for sustained flight. This is already a major limitation in quadrotors, for example. I've long mused about the possibilities for fuel cells in aircraft, which is something I know at least BMW has put research into. Actually in a way I think it's curious that one of the long-term ramifications of the automotive industry's short term pursuit of fuel cells as an alternative to EVs is that it may open up the development of fuel cell aircraft, which would promote drastically different approaches to airborne energy storage and engines, but I'm going off on a bit of a tangent. Point is: how would you propose, in the foreseeable future, to build an electric aircraft? Small-scale nuclear reactors perhaps?
2. SpaceX and Tesla both have a reputation for having a pretty high turnover rate and very poor work/life balance among employees. I can think of a ton of reasons why turnover can be both bad and good in an organization, but do you think this has had a negative effect on the efficacy and pace of development of either company? What are your personal feelings about the company cultures in this regard?
3. If you were personally looking to invest in a new company, what kinds of things would you look for in the company? In the founders? What's your thought process behind examining the potential success of an organization?

If you get a chance, thanks!"

1. Is evolving human transportation the final focus you have in helping humanity? Do you plan to invest in other aspects such as education or health?
2. What drove you past your darkest days  or how did you keep believing in yourself? (i.e living in your office with your brother, investing in the failing Telsa, going for Falcon 9) And why did you choose to pursue higher dreams when you could have settled after selling zip2? 
3. I noticed you're not an expert at public speaking which is irrelevant, because you seem to find and hire people who are passionate on what you believe in. What is your method for finding such people? Do you look for specific things in individuals or do you push forward yourself and hope to attract the best talent?

jtoomim,1,"What do you think of the Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) idea for (mostly) intracity human transportation? 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_rapid_transit

The basic idea is to use small lightweight vehicles on a network of dedicated rails or road tracks, usually elevated, with each vehicle routed non-stop from origin to destination and controlled by computer. 

Proponents claim the system has several benefits:

* Such a system could be made at a low marginal costs, since the lightweight vehicles would require lighter rails and support structures;
* Travel would be faster than by automobile, since 100% computer control could obviate stoplights and enable travel at 50-100 mph during the entire trip;
* Short stopping distances for automated light vehicles would enable sbort following distances and greater throughput per track;
* Small vehicles combined with station bypass lanes would reduce the financial and speed costs of stations and enable dense station placements;
* Vehicles can use cheap, efficient linear induction motors powered electrically by a third rail or catenary system;
* As a shared resource with high duty cycles, amortized capital costs for the vehicles would be much lower per capita than for street cars (plus they would be simpler and cheaper per unit).

Detractors claim the system has a couple main drawbacks:

* It hasn't been made to work before; so
* It will probably be way more expensive than we think, and might not work.

0xbdf,1,"Hi Elon, I'm 29 and founded my first company a year ago with 3 other founders. Irresolvable personal conflicts within the founding group has sabotaged the future of the company and guaranteed its dissolution, yet we all want to deliver our product (a mobile video game, funded on Kickstarter) before going our separate ways.

I have two questions to ask.

1) I have 6 months [before we run out of money and the game will ship, vision realized or not] to make the most out of the experience of running a company. What lessons can I learn, that are best learned now and hard to learn any other time?

2) After leaving my company, I will spend 1-3 years developing my personal infrastructure (build networks, pay student loans, expand social circle, grow as a person, etc) before starting another company. What are the most valuable things to do with time like that, or the most valuable way to treat time like that, to set me up for success on my next endeavor?

Thank you!"

I've been a huge fan of SpaceX and Tesla ever since I first heard of the Roadster, and going for a test drive in a Model S at the Vancouver showroom has reaffirmed everything I love about the cars. However, I have some family that's completely opposed to electric cars. They are convinced that the government will put a tax of ""car electricity"" and make it more expensive to drive a Tesla than it would be to drive a gas car. They are also still under the delusion that all electric cars are slow and weak and have a range of no more than 50 km.

Any ideas about how I could go about showing them how awesome electric cars can be? I've tried to get them to book a test drive for themselves, but they don't seem to be willing to do so…

Could you see this as an effective means of going electric, and what costs do you think would be associated with setting up a rudimentary battery pack.

3) We seem to have a very similar mind capable of soaking up knowledge like sponges and strive to learn about as much as possible. For myself and others who have a hard time deciding on a field of study, do you have any advice on how you decided on software engineering to start?

4) If we figure out a way to deal with AI and limit their ability to become ungoverned, what do you see is our next biggest hurdle as a society?

5) Climate change, silliest way you could solve it GO!

I was wondering how you plan to deal with the tight quarters of the transport module? While the trip is not too long I know some people might be claustrophobia and be in such tight quarters might cause problems.

* 2) As someone who is just starting to major in Computer Science [focus on either Cybersecurity or Artificial Intelligence] I was wondering if you had any tips on how I can better improve any skills that I might learn during college?

One thing that I believe you have done for the culture of entrepreneurship is change the focus from ""social"" applications to popularize building ideas that truly engage some of the most challenging problems the world faces, i.e. renewable energy. For example, SpaceX, Tesla, and Solar City, are all, in some form or fashion, attempting to be part of the solution to large problems.
But one area that I believe has lagged behind is healthcare/biotechnology. Futuristic ideas like gene therapy, personalized medicine, telemedicine, have been slow to develop.

Could it be because that is a challenge that you believe you can not accomplish successfully or through capitalism or other enterprise?

1. Although it is used as a passenger transportation system from Los Angeles area to San Francisco area, do you see this system as a freight transportation system to replace the current railroad system?


2. How much more efficient is the Hyperloop than diesel fuel in terms of transporting heavy-weight manufacturing materials such as large containers?


3. Do you believe the hyperloop technology should be used to replace the current cross-continental railroad system due to its efficiency and quicker transportation time? (conventional train from coast to coast is at least 48 hours without stopping, which then becomes at least a week, while the hyperloop's proposed speed would take 5 hours without stopping, meaning it could make it from coast to coast within 24 hours)


4. If the hyperloop technology replaces the current cross-continental train system, do you believe that factories in the mid-west will increase, and therefore US will have an economical boost because the hyperloop train system can deliver goods from major shipping ports such as Southern California to the East coast without Panama Canal?

i took the initial technical, physics/engineering test, emailed it back, and then heard nothing.  a month or so later i finally heard back from the guy, tesla had not asked for another round of candidates, so i was never submitted.  another opportunity i let myself get excited about, that never panned out.

1) Do you possibly see a large potential for graphene to be used in batteries or other technologies?

2) Also, you have already innovated both the car industry and space industry,  but do you plan on expanding to other transportation industries such as boat, planes, or trains (like the hyperloop)?

vcp323,1,"Hello Mr Musk, 

**My question is: how do I manage to take my robotics hobby and turn it into a successful career in aerospace robotics? I am specifically interested in control systems and machine vision.**

*These are my relevant details:* 
I have been a self-taught C++ programmer for almost 6 years now. I do not have a formal CS degree however I am about to begin my second semester at a community college in the interest of formally pursuing my degree in computer science. Currently I work at home on my own personal robotics projects with friends who are STEM majors. My personal focus in these projects is management, machine vision, and embedded systems. I have very little professional work experience outside of my hobby, but I am actively pursuing internships. Most of my applications are getting rejected since I do not have ""enough classical training"". 

I am an incredibly determined worker and I enjoy working out-of-the-box (as a matter of fact, I am a non-conformist at heart and I love chasing ""impossible"" ideas and bringing them to life). 

Right now I am having a hard time orienting myself and taking root in the field. I am being pressured by professors, family members/friends, and employers alike to pursue a career in cyber security (which is something I have explored and dislike). I am hoping to find a programming position (paid or unpaid) that will give me formal experience relevant to aerospace robotics, however I am struggling to find even a basic programming job for myself. To add insult to injury, I have scanned through university, private-sector, and government websites alike, and I have not been able to find any robotics or non-cyber security programming internships or jobs in my state (Maryland) or in two adjacent states (Virginia and Pennsylvania). 

Something I would like to quickly note is that just because I focus on robotics does not mean that I am ignoring the broader picture of computer science. I make sure that at least once a month I visit random websites (usually university websites) and pull up general practice problems to keep my basic and general coding skills strong. I have also just begun going through Project Euler and using code to solve the math problems there. I have studied and used other languages aside from C++ however C++ is the language I am most comfortable with and the strongest in. It is followed by Python on my list of strong languages. 

Thank you for your time, advice, and inspiration. I look forward to your reply. "

At risk of getting really heavy really fast, I sincerely believe that the single most important thing for the human race is a future in Space. Anything short of that is playing house til our inevitable extinction, whether that comes in 100 years or a million years from now, getting off the planet is the only way to safeguard a long term future. And I desperately want to help but don't know how.

Myself, and I'm sure many like me, have done decently well for ourselves in other careers, but when it comes to advancing what should be the primary cause of the human race I legitimately don't know where to start. I'm not an astrophysicist or an engineer, and to my dismay only discovered I wanted to be an astronaut as an adult. What can I, or others, do to really contribute? And I mean more than a cheering gallery, like actual dedicating lives to the cause and helping with deeds. Is retraining to engineering the only option? Are there other outlets to contribute?

We have had some tantalizing clues that simple life forms might once have existed on Mars, or perhaps that they even still do. We obviously need quite a bit more study with more advanced rovers.

However, once the first muddy human bootprint is placed on Mars, it's pretty much game over for the science, because the surface will become irrevocably contaminated. I don't believe it's even possible to put people on Mars and not contaminate it, no matter how careful you are.

Contaminating Mars before we have done enough science to get a definite idea about past or existing life would be a crime against science of *staggering* proportions.

Think of it as advice. Put yourself in your shoes before your fame and fortune; if you had an amazing website idea (like Paypal for example), but you lacked the knowledge to code and design the website yourself and had limited connections, would you put more effort towards learning how to create the website, towards raising funds to hire developers to create the website... or would you try to gather a team of individuals to collectively work on the website and then split profits in the end? Or would you do something else to make your idea come to life?

What would you do if you knew that your idea was time sensitive and you need to act on it before someone else does?

I'm a college student with a couple of great ideas, limited funding, and limited connections. This is my situation.

I believe that in order for the privatization of space to be truly successful it must become profitable and not reliant on government funding. My question is this, how feasible do you think asteroid mining actually is beyond its use for refueling using water on asteroids (i.e. how feasible is the mining of valuable materials for sale on Earth)? What other ways can space become profitable besides commercial satellite launches and asteroid mining? "

1. As a South African, we all follow your exploits with great pride. Would you ever consider bringing some of your magic to SA? Solar panels for poor people, a launch centre/other technical infrastructure here, even some Teslas?

Each one would be designed as sort of a spider with the legs having clamps to sort of bolt into the asteroid surface on contact, do you think about this?

I think about this a lot. Then of course i wonder would it be nice to be able to control that asteroid because each spider module has a large rocket on its back?

I see more and more goals set as if for publicity than focus on the original task (low cost LEO transport). I'd love to work for a spaceflight company after I graduate, but the largest hesitation with applying to SpaceX is that I see a push for great things, which is good, but I also want the company to achieve those great things as well. Why should I pour out my passion for space travel in a company talking about going to Mars that has yet to put a man into space?

In summary, it's important to have high goals because they inspire us to reach higher, but if we set our goals too high without grasping and understanding the supporting picture of things, it can become a slope of discouraging defeat. Just as you said previously, it is important to understand the supporting background so that the related knowledge and in this case, gains, don't fall away.

I was watching an interview with you and it just seems that the way you look at things is so straightforward that it makes a big thing, like building a rocket,seem simple. When you were asked a question about how you began to build a rocket you said somthing along the lines of, ' i looked around for rocket manufactures and the current companies/governments prices were unrealistic for your plans, and I just thought, well what do i need to make a rocket, and bought all the raw materials and made it for a fraction of the price.'

Why do you think that these companies cant/wouldnt do the same thing, why does it cost them a ridiculously larger price for their rockets? Is it just governments and private contractors on the side just jacking up the price of things?

 In past interviews I recall you saying that a more affordable Tesla was in the works. I believe you said it was to be around $30k and was wondering if this was planning to be released this year? Are there any plans to make it even more affordable than that and maybe there is plans to release a hatchback model? 


*(2) Progress with a trip to Mars. 
Outside of SpaceX, I am hearing a lot about another group of people who have already signed up and are ready to start the new world out on Mars. Obviously your mission as well has been to make it to Mars and was wondering if SpaceX or yourself has any connection to these group of people who seem hopeful to do it ""relatively"" soon. Also, In an interview with you (about a year or two ago) you said you predict us to send thousands of people to Mars in 13 years? Right? Well, how is that progress going and will you be on that first mission? 

*(3) What are your connections to companies working on artificial intelligence? 
The world is now aware of your concern with A.I. We pretty much take your concerns seriously now, at least I do. I heard that you have invested yourself into some A.I companies. What are some ways you are going about trying to keep the progress of A.I safe for our future survival. 


And Finally (sorry, tried to keep it short)

alasdairlumsden,1,"Dear Elon Musk,

I love what you're doing with SpaceX, it has enormous potential to change the world. Space is an enormous frontier that really inspires the imagination. I, along with countless others I'm sure, hope we'll one day live amongst the stars!

However one of the biggest challenges facing humanity here on Earth today, is of course global climate change. I understand you've been trying to address this with ventures such as Solar City. However Solar is diffuse, and intermittent, and in countries such as the UK, isn't really viable as an energy source - there simply isn't enough energy falling on each square foot of land. Storage and transmission is enormously expensive, and could take a long time to roll out.

One potential technology that I and many others believe could change the world, is Molten Salt Reactors, which are a radically different way of doing Nuclear Power. I wondered if you were aware of them, and if you felt it might be expedient to invest in such a venture?

The most interesting Molten Salt Reactor project I've seen thus far comes from an engineer with an amazing career history in ship building. He hasn't just designed a new reactor, he has designed an entire mass manufacturing process, in addition to ongoing maintenance through to final decommissioning. More information can be found here:

http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/01/prweb12422236.htm

As well as on the homepage:

http://thorconpower.com/

The most exciting part of this is that if realised, it has the potential to generate electricity <b>cheaper than coal</b>. If you have an energy source cheaper than coal, you don't need political willpower, because market forces, economics and the profit motive will take care of the rest.

It is effectively a blueprint for solving climate change, as existing coal plants can be refitted with these, hooked up to the existing steam generators and transmission systems.

I believe strongly that this type of technology is our energy future. All it requires is a bold person with a passion for disruptive technologies and a vision of a brighter world.

Mr Musk, would you ever consider looking into this further, given the potential benefits?

Kind Regards,

Alasdair Lumsden"

LiJaughnsun,1,"You, like Mr. Tesla, seek to advance your species. Thank you!
When you posted the Hyperloop technicalities, I was inspired to brainstorm. This isn't much of a question, but your projects will be fundamental for the the next evolutionary step(s):

For a time, Mars-bound logistics vessels will be provide one-way freight to the prospective planet. The vessels themselves must be designed such that they can be dismantled upon arrival, providing structural material for mining locations. Once sufficient constructive mass has traveled from Earth to Mars, it may then have its own mining/smelting/refining capacity and can then provide its own fuel (likely uranium) and materials for expansion.

It is important to discontinue fantasies and hopes of extra-terrestrial beings (alien life). A more efficient and empowering ideal is to view your own species as the future alien. Fifty thousand years of growth after the impact of the Information Age will yield a breed of life that resembles the generic ""Roswell Alien"" - enlarged bare head, smaller body, pasty skin, dark eyes, and a potential new sense derived from an embedding of electrical augmentations. Even now there are noticeable changes in the human form - the implementation of the Internet has increased vision-correction prescription eyewear (decades of rectangular screen-viewing), and the necessity to utilize the brain has resulted in a trend of patterned-baldness (temperature control system, with the same utility as the de-evolution of body hair).

Mars will likely be reserved exclusively for scientific endeavors (Silicon Planet). It is likely that the fusion breakthrough will occur here. The only returning freight will be passengers and rare elements. The price of Earth gold (or platinum, silver) will fluctuate wildly as it will no longer maintain its place as a traditional currency (a shiny object assigned artificial value). It's value will be similar to copper - electrical/elemental/durability properties - likely costing twice as much.

There will be medical hurdles to overcome. The gravity is less than half that of Earth (3.7 m/s/s < 9.8 m/s/s). The human physiology evolved from several forms over vast stretches of time before it acquired the capacity to exit the atmosphere. The pressure maintained by blood-flow is adapted to such a resistive force. Delivery systems running up the length of the leg are prepared to transmit the longest distance of any part of the body against the force of Earths gravity. Solutions to this would include precise physical exertion requirements, coupled with limited shift duration perhaps defined by data derived from long-term ISS inhabitants.

Terra-forming is the ultimate long-term goal. A key element lacking in its atmosphere is nitrogen. Earth contains nearly 80% of it whereas Mars has a negligible 2%. This element is essential to vegetative plant growth (oxygen production fuel). Most of the Martian atmosphere contains CO2 which would be the oxygen source. Nitrogen is the seventh most abundant element in the galaxy, and would likely be present on Mars once mining operations release it from the ground.

Material science may be see adverse revision under the same criteria as the human body. The halved gravity will effect structural integrity relative to the way it would have worked on Earth. Computer simulations may be able to take this into account and accurately predict the nature of Martian blueprints.

There are many systems that must be established and maintained before an exponential threshold can be reached. Interstellar transmission of equipment will be slow and steady at first until the orbits resemble an Earth interstate. The steady traffic may necessitate the establishment of orbital service stations between the 3rd and 4th planet. Since supply lines can no longer be calculated linearly, there must be an understanding of timing and orbits in order to arrive at certain stations at certain times of the year. Two-way traffic will load and unload a fraction of their freight (fuel for supply line upkeep), consequentially allowing Mars-bound vessels greater fuel economy by decreasing their launch mass.

Once the supply lines have provided Martian establishments with their own production capacity, they will quickly grow. The prices of Earth goods and commodities will fluctuate relative to Martian supply. Fuel costs will plummet with this vast new source from which to draw. The increased Martian production will release pockets of nitrogen and alter atmosphere composition. It will be necessary to import certain bacterial DNA to process the elements for the foundation of vegetative growth.

Water supply will be the greatest challenge. Potential solutions would be the incorporation of vast quantities of Earth water transferred into the supply line, or somehow redirecting an ice comet to collide with Mars. The former solution would endanger fundamental systems that sustain life on Earth.

An eventual goal would be the cultivation of asteroid fields for large city-sized vessels constructed in orbit. The abundance of Jupiter gas could be harvested for fuel.

SpaceX has stated that it's long term goal is Mars colonization, which I am 100% behind as I agree we need to get off this rock and onto as many other space rocks as possible in case something happens to this one. That being said, the SpaceX website shows some sort of terraforming process on mars, converting it into a planet that is more Earth like. Obviously there's some major challenges there but the one that I really don't think anyone has addressed is the lack of a (sufficiently strong) magnetic field. The Van Allen belts around earth stop most of the high energy particles from reaching the surface and the magnetic field protects our atmosphere from being blown away by the solar winds. Without a magnetic field wouldn't any potential colonists deal with excessive levels of radiation and any atmosphere generated be lost almost immediately to space? "

Over the last century the worlds of science and engineering have been developing layers of abstraction, so new generations of researchers and entrepreneurs see less and less of the underlying complexity of the world. This can be seen in Technology, Physics and Medicine - just to highlight a few disciplines where new innovations hide the technicalities of the fundamental underlying theories and building blocks.
This complexity abstraction is potentially a natural trajectory for innovation that drives cycles in fundamental research and commercialization e.g. how classical mechanics and thermodynamics led to the industrial revolution and quantum mechanics to the information age.

However, do you think this narrowing perspective in the depth and breadth of how the world really works is resulting in more and more incremental change rather than revolutionary change, so we will see more and more Snap-chat and WhatsApp type of businesses from the entrepreneurial private sector and less and less world changing ideas like the Jacquard loom, the airplane, the light bulb and the personal computer?

2. What impact do you think such complexity abstraction will have on the human race’s pursuit to reach its potential and become a star faring civilization?

joeydsa,1,"Thank you Mr. Musk. I love what you do at SpaceX and Telsa Motors, however as a Transportation Planning student I would like to ask a few questions, and give some observations, on the Hyperloop.  

1. Will there be potential for intermediate stops? 

2. Will vehicles be able two ""switch between tubes as standard rail technology does. 

3. Building on that, will deferent routes with different destinations be able to share a guideway for a portion of there route, as standard rail technology does.

4. What is a likely cost/mile for the Hyperloop.

5. Would it have stations in the central business districts of Cities it serves.

I'm excited about Hyperloop technology and what it could mean for future ground transportation. However, I feel your California proposal is not an adequate alternative to the California high speed rail project unless it makes intermediate stops and has stations in the central business district of each city, which is an advantage of traditional high speed rail technology. 

I'm excited to see what comes of this project!

**Space X**

* We know that your ultimate aim with SpaceX is to get humanity to Mars, you along with it. Do you plan expanding your business(es) to Mars once it's colonized?

* Do you see successful colonization happening within your lifetime?

* What would a Mars colony look like, in your mind?

* Have you received any negative feedback regarding SpaceX's private contract with NASA? (from any individual or party, public or private)

**Tesla Motors**

* Was the order of Tesla Motors vehicles intentional? Meaning starting off with a high-dollar luxury vehicle and working backwards to create more affordable and family-friendly models that can be mass produced. 

* How do your marketing strategies compare to those of the larger, more established companies such as Ford, and what sort of audience are you trying to attract? 

**Personal**

* Late 2012, you finally purchased the $17M property you had, until that point, been renting. Who rents to Elon Musk?

* Will you be at the opening of the Nicolai Tesla Museum? 

* What's your favorite flavor of cake? "

twinbee,1,"It's an honour to have you here with us on Reddit for a short while. Here's my Qs about Tesla Motors with the most important first:

**1**: You've open-sourced Tesla's patents for the benefit of progressing EV technology in general. Are there any features in particular you'd like to include in Tesla's cars but can't because they've been locked down by other car companies?

**2:** Some people have expressed concern a new battery technology may jeopardize your upcoming battery gigafactories. Has there (or will there) be much effort to help make sure the gigafactories are forwards compatible with future potential battery chemistries?

**3**: One nice advantage with EVs over gasoline cars is that the response of the gas pedal feels much more 'snappy'. I hear the Roadster responds in about 7 milliseconds (versus gasoline's 100ms approx.). Can you confirm the Roadster's lag, and also let us know the lag for the Model S (which apparently feels slightly less snappy than the Roadster)?

**4**: What is your attitude towards zero maintenance? Do you put any emphasis on long-lasting parts, and hope to produce a car that may last 100 years or more?

johnnyblac,1,"Hey Mr. Musk. I've seen you speak in person (at UCLA a few years ago), and your brilliance is readily apparent. Thanks for your contributions to society. 

My question: I am a TSLA shareholder, and notice that whenever the stock price drops for some reason, within the next week or so, TSLA announces some positive news which counters the negative drop. For example, the latest positive news the company has put out was the battery swap stations, preceded by the news of the P85D, etc. 

Do the executives at TSLA purposely release positive news to counter negative market reactions? Or is this just a happy coincidence? If it is the former, I really appreciate the efforts.

In fact, several launches ago, you announced there would be no webcast or video coverage at all, though that was rescinded after the launch was rescheduled and all subsequent launches have had minimal coverage.

Why is this? Is there a significant cost to making these streams available? Is the cost technical or human? If the latter: As someone who almost religiously watches these: I'd be totally fine if you just streamed the video streams and the primary radio net without any commentary whatsoever.

ivandam,1,"Hi Elon,
Two questions (reliability + AI for space colonization):

1. Would the recovered engine be reliable? As far as I understand, rocket engines experience a lot of stress during flight. Would the recovered engine maintain enough integrity for repeated use? In other words, are there any estimates on how many flights could one engine take under the normal ""wear and tear"" conditions? 

2. You said in several interviews that a true AI could be very dangerous. IMO it is possible that we will require such advanced autonomous AI for rapid space colonization. For example, a swarm of clever robots could be sent to Mars or the asteroid belt to construct space habitat out of the locally available materials. Question: should we work on creating an AI to help us in space colonization?

1) What do do you think is the biggest challenge facing tesla right now? Is it political/governmental with the legal issue about direct selling cars brought up by Automobile Dealers Association/their lobbying firm and the federal tax rebate for cars that is set to reduce in 2019 and set to expire in 2022, and the changing in the number of credits in the VEZ in 2018/the favoritism of hydrogen fuel cars in the fast refueling requirement?

2) Before you have mentioned in interviews that you would be possible willing to sell telsa if someone had the resources (either in stock or money) to buy telsa, are you still willing to sell tesla if the right offer comes up?

3) You have mentioned an idea of an electric airplane before, any updates? Are you possibly willing to do something like you are with the hyperloop and give some information out to the public?

4) Larry Paige and some other really wealthy people have said that they think leaving their money to you would be more beneficial overall than leaving it to a non-profit or a charity.  How do feel about this and if you say got an extra 10-20 billion dollars in funding what would you end you using it for? Tesla, spaceX, solar city or other side projects (hyperloop/electric plane)?

chinri1,1,"Can you say a bit more about why you're so concerned about the dangers of AI? I look at the field of machine learning as essentially working towards an automated universal query answering engine. Now, if someone were to use such a thing to build an autonomous world-destroying engine, they probably could do some damage, but to me that's a bit like the first person who saw a black powder flash wondering what *couldn't* you blow up with enough of the stuff. Anything one machine can do, others can find a defense against.

I think the stronger argument against that is that if you really did want to take over the world, eventually you will have to solve some kind of constraint satisfaction problem that *will* turn out to be NP-hard. In that case even having a quantum computer will not fundamentally change anything. I think the more interesting likely outcome is that AI will help link people into collaborative teams that can outperform any single human or computer, as is already happening in the world of chess. Anything a computer can do faster than a human, some human will make a tool to do for themselves, but the thing we're no closer to than any other point is making a computer that really cares one way or another who is pulling the lever."

Both have dangers (you can have catastrophic failure in both hostile environment of Venus [acidic] or Mars [freezing]) but Venus is similar size (no bone loss), closer to earth in case of emergencies, it still has an atmosphere which may be easier to fix than a planet without one, and having floating cities due to Venus pressure sounds like it could be a cheaper build."

Strongerthanyouare,1,"[""I've been an engineer with SpaceX for over five years now. I've seen and helped the company grow from less than 500 people in to the powerhouse it is now. I highly doubt that there is a cooler company in the world than SpaceX. Everything that's been said is certainly true. SpaceX really is awesome. What's been said is just one part of what it's like to work with Elon Musk so I'll discuss the side that you won't often hear.
If you want a family or hobbies or to see any other aspect of life other than the boundaries of your cubicle, SpaceX is not for you and Elon doesn't seem to give a damn. 
This side of what it's like to work with Elon shows that no one likes working with Elon. You can always tell when someone's left an Elon meeting: they're defeated. These are some of the hardest working and brightest people in the world, mind you. And they are universally defeated. At least in engineering, who knows what HR and finance does.
The reason for this is that Elon's version of reality is highly skewed. It's much like Steve Jobs's ""reality distortion field"" except Elon isn't great at public speaking. If you believe that a task should take a year then Elon wants it done in a week. He won't hesitate to throw out six months of work because it's not pretty enough or it's not ""badass"" enough. But in so doing he doesn't change the schedule. 
One of the most famous quotes that runs around the office is one from a company wide talk Elon gave a couple of years ago where he said ""Not enough of you are working on Saturdays."" Of course reality kicks in and either junk product gets flown or something terrible happens. Ultimately the schedule slips--surprise surprise, fatigue is real. 
It's understandable. Putting people on Mars is not a small task especially given the overwhelming political obstacles that face SpaceX's mission. Continuously being the underdog, fighting the ULA behemoth and the entrenched politicians that strangely want SpaceX to fail is only a small part of it. SpaceX certainly requires a hard mentality. But so often Elon's leadership is best compared to a master who berates and smacks his dog for not being able to read his mind. 
Nothing you ever do will be good enough so you have to find your own value, not depending on praise to get you through your obviously insufficient 80 hour work weeks.
In order to continue working with Elon, you have to learn to ignore almost everything he says and you have to be prepared to be jabbed over and over. ""Just six more months and we'll go IPO!"" is among his most repeated lines though he stopped trying to sell that a couple years ago as people stopped believing it long ago. 
It is a great company and I do love it. But is isn't the pie in the sky, everything's great idea that so many seem to think.""](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-work-with-Elon-Musk/answers/5559684)

1) Could you provide a detailed explanation of your daily routine? Maybe we can learn something from it.

2) In an interview at the Oil and Gas summit in Norway, you mentioned we could get to the half a million dollar mark to get people to Mars in 25 years from now. If we indeed travel to Mars and get there, how do you think we could survive in such a hostile environment? What kind of technology do you think will be required for sustaining life in Mars?

3) As the real life Tony Stark, do you think the Iron man suit is a possibility? If yes, what would be the key challenges to make such a suit and how long would it take to invent such a suit?

4) How long do you think it will take AI to be as smart as humans? Do you think a threat from AI is a possibility in the next 10 years? Don’t you think we would have a failsafe to prevent such a disaster from happening? Isn’t it a possibility for AI and humans to work cooperatively?

5) How long do you think we will take to harness all our energy from renewable sources? What are the practical difficulties for moving towards renewable energy?

6) What are your solutions for global warming? How do you think we can move towards sustainable development?

7)  When will electric vehicles be the norm? Or will it be the norm? Will there be a more efficient alternative technology such as fuel cells or nuclear batteries which could run for thousands of years?

8)  What are the practical challenges to make batteries smaller? We have been able to make micro and Nano scale transistors but the same could not be said about batteries. Why is this so?

9) What are the implications and challenges in cutting rocket costs? Once your falcon 9 rocket successfully lands, how much cost would you be cutting when compared with traditional rockets? Will you be able to send payloads to space cheaper than India?

10) In the future, do you think there will be a single world economy and collaboration to work towards the betterment of mankind?

11) Would you encourage other entrepreneurs to follow you in making patents open source? What are the business implications for not holding on to your patents?

12) What do you think is the best way for a company to innovate its products? What kind of a work culture should be promoted for development in innovation?

13) In an interview you mentioned you would sell half a million cars by 2020. Which markets are you going to focus on and how do you expect to achieve such a huge number?

14) The battery mega factory you are constructing is truly a masterclass in engineering. What are the new technologies/robotics we would be able to see in the factory? What will be the per day capacity of the factory?

15) What advice would you give someone starting a new venture?"

Nickolai1989,0,"TL;DR: How does SpaceX plan to deal with the (potentially significant) reduction in manufaturing capacity that would be brought on by highly-reusable rockets?

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on something that I think might be an issue for any company that is successful in developing reusable rockets. As you start reusing the rockets, the need to manufacture new rockets goes down, assuming the rocket can be re-used many times* and the launch market doesn't increase significantly as launch costs go down.

This leaves you with the issue of excess manufacturing capacity, which means either maintaining a costly excess manufacturing capacity, laying off a lot of people to reduce those costs (and losing their valuable knowledge), or limiting the number of times you re-use a rocket in order to artificially keep up manufacturing demand (which is less than ideal since it prevents costs from going down too much).

Ideally the demand goes up as the supply of cheap lauches goes up, but what if it doesn't? Do you think this is a likely scenario, and if so, how do you think SpaceX might deal with it?

*Given your stated goal to reduce launch costs by a factor of 10 or more, I'm assuming that a rocket can be re-used at least 10 times. Since SpaceX is currently manifesting ~12 launches per year, one or two rockets would be enough to cover a year's manifest, barring launch failures."

koookie,0,"Currently no car I know of has truly well working automatic AC. I can think of two problems:

1a) Too small air ducts forces AC fan RPMs too high, which is noisy and restricts the maximum power of heat transfer.

1b) The low power means it takes long to deice windows. Electric heating elements are used even in petrol cars to speed deicing up, but it's still slow -- and even when deiced, the windows easily fog up before the car is actually warm. Poor visibility is seriously dangerous.

2) The heating effect of solar rays is ignored, which causes people in the car to be too hot, even if the air temperature is OK. Mostly a problem during spring.

Do Tesla cars solve these problems in any way? I imagine the electric AC heating elements are larger than in petrol cars? Could it be possible to use support structures as air ducts?

Neregate,0,"A couple questions to Elon-sensei!

• SpaceX has a reputation of doing things not like the others, and going into unexplored ""territories"" as a first-timer. 

Tomorrow's launch is yet another exciting example of that.
My first question would be : How do your customers (NASA, etc.) perceive and position themselves against you, SpaceX, experimenting bold (I cannot find a word more appropriate than that one) new technologies and ideas like tomorrow's attempt to land the first stage on a ship? By that, I mean that you have to make significant alterations to the rocket and the systems, increasing the risks of something unfortunate happening at any stage of the launch (even if, in tomorrow's case, that additionnal risk should be null after the first stage separates itself from the rest).
Are you customers worried of being part of these ""experiments""? Or do they understand what lies beyond your moves, and give you their understanding support, taking in the risks in order to find a greater benefit in the long term? I believe it's both, but space is a greedy place after all! What works in the mind does not always work on paper.


• I read that ultimately, your goal is to land the first stage not on the sea but directly on the launchpad (or somewhere close to it). In the past, we have always avoided this practice for safety reasons. While I understand that there'll be a lot of safety systems in place, what if they all fail (even if the probability is very low)? Given the mass of the first stage, the distance from the ground as well as its falling speed, it'd probably make quite some damage when touching the ground. The worst case scenario would be if it'd hit civilian areas.
Of course, I don't even want to think this'd ever happen, but this is something that ultimately you'd have to consider. While I don't think you have a definitive answer on that as of today (given the complexity of the problem), do you have some ideas as to how you'd approach the problem?


Thank you so much for sharing some of your time with us. Me, and I'm sure many more, are ""D""lighted for realz (puns most definitely intended) by your presence. ;)"

Thank you for this AMA.
I have a few questions (they are not related to the rocket launch tomorrow sorry)...

1) How did you first start developing a company with little funds?
2) I would like to know where did you start to learn programming, electronics, etc. in order to work on your projects?
3) Did you work on your projects with teams? Is it better to work with a team?
4) I have a few great ideas that I would like to work on, yet I don't have the funds or some of the knowledge to work on it, where should I start?
5) There are many great entrepreneurs that are doing as well as you, yet what makes you possibly the most innovative? You always figure out a solution to a problem and if it fails you still have a lot of money to restart on that project, how can I learn from that?
6) I plan on starting a company and I would like to know if you did it with a group? 
7) I am also working on a way to apply graphene to cars, any advice on where can I learn about creating a car and an graphene engine (I know this question sounds like a lot to answer, but I would love to learn)?

Thank you so much for this again! I am sorry for the amount of questions I am asking, I just want to make a mark on the world like you. A lot of these questions deal with the thought that where/how can I start learning about anything electronics, computer programming, physics, advanced math, etc. related.

I have the great privilege to be able to have an S85D on order. Prior to ordering I had a nice test drive and I only had one issue: The seats weren't all that great.

I have 2 questions I hope you would answer, although they are just about seats:

1) Are you involved in deciding what is standard and what is an option (and when it is an option)?

Does it bother you as a taxpayer for NASA to pay billions for launches using previously written off dangerous 40 year old engines?


Now Tesla related. Can't you just choose smaller electric motors For the Model 3 that produce half the torque but also sip kilowatts so the packs have 50-100% greater range? If not, why not?
Also, have you ever seriously considered creating a 2nd gear which would not only allow a much greater vehicle range due to motor efficiency, but also faster high speed acceleration and higher top speeds.

I love your approach to taking an active hand in making some revolutionary changes in chasing Mars, and with reviving the electric cars! Thanks for your contributions to society. "
dorculas,0,"Hey Elon! So, I recently watched your interview with Kevin Rose where you mentioned something about the “first principles” method to brainstorming. I thought this explanation was extremely insightful to what you find the 5 areas that will have the most important effect on humanity are, as you discussed in another interview with Steve Jurvetson at Stanford. This got me curious, and led me to research everything and anything I could find on the internet about the principles of communication for the ultimate goal of figuring out the best way to use the internet as a communication interface to the world. Consequentially, I created an app. (shameless self plug: peepdeck.co). I’m extremely curious as to what you think the effect of the rise of a technological singularity will have on human-to-computer-to-human interaction. Like, how are language, media(photos, videos) and content going to evolve in these instances. Also, Can I get your thoughts on the philosophy that backs this app so I know if I’m heading in the right direction with this? “URLs are passages into different worlds, similar to books. Sharing a link to someone is like giving someone a key to open the door to a part of their consciousness, whereas books are like giving someone the code to a padlock on the same door. Entering these doors are going to get easier, and giving away the keys are going to get easier and more aware - the beauty of the internet’s effect on communication is that it can add an extra layer of awareness to the world that can verify things that you wouldn’t have been aware of before. PeepDeck is a solution that gives those keys away at a higher efficiency and confidence that the person on the other side actually used the keys.”

I’m looking forward to hearing the good news tomorrow. :)

Would you consider adding in physical buttons and knobs in future Tesla models?

2) How was Tesla able to create a car that is 10 years ahead of any manufacturers out there? How were you able to manage your engineers and designers in order to break the current status quo in car designs?

David_Parker,0,"Dear Mr. Musk,

What advice do you have for someone attempting to invent and sell something for the first time with no business training in a niche market?"
Jah348,0,"I've recently been talking with friends comparing the pros and cost of EV and hydrogen powered vehicles. I know you don't exactly support hydrogen cars but could you elaborate upon that. My train of thought is that the process starts with X energy. To produce hydrogen that X energy goes to a production plant to become X-1 energy due to said plant not being a series of Carnot functions cycles (100% efficient). This is without mentioning any loss between the production and the distribution line. Once in the car we are left with X-1, better known as less energy than originally started with. Now onto EV, the power is generated then sent directly to the vehicle. It goes without mentioning that both vehicles will suffer energy loss throughout the drivetrain, so we'll neglect that for now. The EV will plug in, charge, and X energy will be fed to the drivetrain as opposed to X-1. In my relatively elementary understanding I see EV being more efficient as described. 

However weight is another issue. Batteries are far from light, not to imply that compressors and energy cells are not. The amount of energy you have being fed into the drivetrain competes directly against the mass of the vehicle so now in terms of energy ""waste"" I'm stuck in the mud for which side to take. At the end of the day I'm in favor of either as long as they're not oil.

Oh and final part: if you can't tell with the minor obsession with details I'm an engineering student.  When and where can I apply? Oh! and do you still have the F1? Genuinely the inspiration that led me to engineering. I went to McLaren of Palo Alto a few years ago during the 2 weeks of time the F1 just so happened to be out of the dealership.

earlierson,-1,"Mr. Musk, 
[In a September article entitled Exodus](http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/the-elon-musk-interview-on-mars/) you argued that hope for humanities future resides in Mars. Reading that article, from hearing your thoughts on the colonization of Mars to simply listening to someone as smart and talented as yourself expound on the reality of interplanetary travel, made me feel oddly justified in spending so much time dreaming of life on another planet, as I’m sure is true for many of my generation.  

My question has to do with actually leaving Earth for Mars. As a private entity, you may (to some extent) operate outside of the control of national governments (e.g. you can build whatever rocket you want, and if you comply with regulations, blast away into orbit). 

**What regulations do you believe national governments (particularly the US Government) will place on your colonization of Mars?** Initially, the trips will undoubtedly be one way, which may be problematic (given the inherent risk of such a mission) because the US Government does not currently recognize a private citizens [right to die] (http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17920279791882194984&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr). 

Have you considered whether national governments will allow individuals to be sent to another planet?

FANGO,-1,"Hi Elon, happy early TSLA shareholder, Roadster owner and EV evangelist here.  I'm excited about the brake drag improvements mentioned in the recent blog post about Roadster upgrades, and hope I can get this upgrade applied on it's own without having to purchase the whole package.  Love that Tesla is supporting older vehicles, and I think this shows to the world that Tesla is leading the way among automakers.

You've mentioned many times that the Roadster is not a roadtrip car.  This being the case, is there some chance that we could get a lighter battery, rather than a larger one, at some point?  I don't particularly need or want more range, but I would love to have the improved balance, handling, braking, acceleration, tire wear, and even efficiency that a smaller battery would provide, presumably cheaper than a larger battery as well.  The blog post said that other improvements are coming in the future, could this possibly be one of them, pretty please?"

None,-1,"Hello, Elon!

Thank you for being the best thing that happened to space industry since the Moon landings.

Primary questions: I know you've mentioned previously that you hope to die on Mars. But do you envision Mars-based businesses ever being economically competitive with Earth? In what way? Otherwise, wouldn't capitalism essentially redelegate Mars to just being an expensive tourist destination?

Additional questions, if you don't mind: 

1) Have you ever considered creating a Falcon rocket version with four side boosters (similar to Russia's Angara A5 rocket), instead of Heavy's two? Could that be a backup plan in case the Raptor engine development encounters significant delays?

2) Do you consider that humans are in any way better (looking at the ratio of mission cost versus scientific output) than human-controlled robots? Especially with the progress that is currently being made with anthropomorphic robots and AI? What is a type of mission where sending a human scientist would justify a much greater cost (one to two orders of magnitude)

3) On the subject of AI. Have you read the book ""Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era"" by James Barrat? Have you considered investing money into the creation of ""friendly"" AI?

theweasel2345,-2,"Hi Mr. Musk,

I had a quick question which hopefully doesn’t require a lengthy response. My question is concerning the founding of SpaceX and Tesla. So obviously you thought of developing these companies or something like them. What was your first move to bring your idea into real life? Was it a phone call to an engineering company seeing if they could develop parts or was it a the purchasing of a factory that could produce it or was it an amalgamation of events that led to the same point?

Also, I admire and greatly respect your work ethic. Nobody, in any of your interviews asked how you were in your life outside of business because, as you have said, you work 100 hours a week. As someone who wants to emulate that, what is your life like outside of business? Are you still driving that McLaren F1 (which is the best car ever)?

Thank you for your time! I’m taking the MCAT on Saturday and have been living by your word of “work twice as hard as your opposition” to keep me motivated."

I am a huge fan of your work, so naturally I have many questions that you may or may not have answered yet. I'm a student in Ohio,
13 years old and aiming to pursue an engineering career, to give you context.

1) Do you believe that your college degrees (economics and physics) helped you be an entrepreneur?

2) Did you like college? Any fun stories?

3) Do you have a proper biography lined up (pleaaaaaaaase Walter Isaacson or auto)?

4) What is your favorite biography, fiction, and nonfiction?

5) What did you want to be growing up?

6) How were your grades in high school and college? 

7) Did you get a scholarship for college and/or grad school?

8) What is your favorite food?

9) How do you feel about the Model D being a kind of flop (stock market wise)?

10) Do you think that falling oil prices will hurt Tesla?

11) Do you have any other ventures that you're thinking of?

12) What do you think made you so successful?

13) What would you classify your lifestyle as (extravagent? humble?)

14) How many times per week, on average, do you look yourself up on Google or Wikipedia (be honest)?

15) Have you ever found an error on your Wikipedia page?

16) In the wake of fallen oil prices, when do you predict that electric cars will overtake gas ones?

17) What is your favorite Youtube channel? (try SciShow, vlogbrothers, CGPGrey, minutephysics, and 
minuteearth)

18) What is your goal in life?

19) Do you have any productivity tips?

20) What is your favorite show on Netflix?

21) What is your favorite movie?

23) Do you browse Reddit frequently?

24) Do you have any study habits you would like to share?

25) Do you have any life lessons, in general, that you would like to share?

26) In personal finance class, we did a stock market virtual simulation, and the week before Model D launched, I bought TSLA, thinking
the Model D would live up to the hype. Sadly, it didn't, and I lost $30,000. Not really a question, just a funny story I never thought
I would share with you :)

27) Do you like Korean food?

28) Also, no offense, but from far away your Twitter headshot looks like Kim Jung Un

Hello, Mr. Musk, thank you for doing this AMA. On Tuesday, SpaceX will launch a Falcon 9 rocket, and attempt to land it on a barge in the Atlantic Ocean. If successful, this will make a major step towards leaping the hurdle of reusability for rockets, and would bring down space-flight costs to just hundredths of what they are now. 

After the problem of reusability is solved, what is the next problem that SpaceX will tackle to make humanity a more space-faring species?

Garethp,-3,"Something something hire me, something something visionary genius, something something tesla.

But kidding aside, well done mate. You've done what many of us wish we could have done. You've changed the world in not so small ways. Changed the minds of people, changed an industry and changed what we thought could be done.

So my question. Has this changed *you*? If so: How? If not: Why not?"
Logicalpeace,-3,Do you think people will be driving Teslas on Mars one day?
kmartin_socialcorpse,-3,"Mr. Musk,

In a 2012 interview with Wired magazine, you compared the internet to humanity's collective nervous system. In a 2014 interview with The Worldpost, you called humanity a ""superorganism."" In adopting this perspective of humanity, you are in excellent company: Aristotle. Hegel. Karl Marx. Carl Jung. Adam Smith. Jonas Salk. And many others.

You have also declared life becoming multiplanetary to be the next great leap forward in evolution--analogous, perhaps, to life becoming multicellular. In that respect, spacecraft that transmit our living DNA will fertilize Mars in the same way that sperm fertilize an egg. [Rockets](http://www.spacex.com/falcon9) and [sperm](http://i.imgur.com/1yiMyAF.jpg) both have a propulsory tail, a midpiece with stored energy, and a cargo-carrying head. Rockets have a [payload fairing](http://i.imgur.com/5xk1d85.jpg) that streamlines and protects the rocket while it passes through the atmosphere of a planet, after which the fairing is jettisoned, exposing the payload; sperm have a protective [acrosome cap](http://i.imgur.com/qb2ASlv.jpg) that helps the head pass through the ovum's outer membrane, after which the cap breaks apart, exposing the DNA.

You dream of building a reusable rocket. Tomorrow, your dream will hopefully come one step closer to reality with a successful recovery of Falcon 9's first stage. (I'll be watching the launch live in person! Good luck!) This technology will dramatically lower the economic cost of accessing space--yet it won't have as big of an impact on the *energetic* costs of accessing space. Each rocket that we send to orbit still needs to pay its own way in terms of fuel, and it needs more fuel to lift that fuel, and so on, leaving less available lift for the payload.

In the human body, this isn't a problem. Most of the energy that transports sperm toward the ovum is provided by the male's body through ejaculation. It is only once the sperm have been delivered through the lubricated urethra into the vagina that they begin using their on-board energy to propel themselves toward their goal.

[According to NASA astronaut and chemical engineer Don Pettit](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html), ""If we want to break the tyranny of the rocket equation, new paradigms of operating and new technology will be needed."" I'm sure you're familiar with a [mass driver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_driver), a tubular structure that shoots large loads off of a planetary body into space. Such a structure would have a high start-up cost; but it would allow us to transport more mass into orbit with each launch, increasing our spacefaring capabilities and paying for itself over time. It might just ""spread the legs of space,"" so to speak. Have you ever looked into the feasibility of building a mass driver? And have you ever considered how similar Hyperloop would be to such a structure?

Thanks.

p.s. I'm writing a book and you're in it.

Wanted to ask you about your thoughts on extrasolar colonisation. 

Firstly, do you think Mars will go the way of the Moon landings? Where a few people over a number of years go there and return, only to stop sending humans? Or will we make a continuing effort to colonise the planet? Once we get started, will human endeavours to colonise Mars/ other places in the Solar System speed up, or will it be more or less an ISS scenario with researchers at a base?

Also, wanted to ask what your thoughts were on exploring Venus’ upper atmosphere. There has been some talk recently in the community that this may be a better option to explore for colonisation than Mars even. 

Again, thank you for doing the AMA, I look forward to reading through all your responses!

Tesla, again it doesn't make any money based on the sales of it cars however it makes money by selling carbon credits, again a tie to government bullshit.
Then we come to Solar City, the company that ""leases"" solar panels to home owners via the power company. The whole business plan is to have people go door to door selling leases and then getting home owners to sign over their government rebates. It just seems like he doesn't have any real businesses that can make money with out some form of subsidy either directly from or mandated by the government.
I don't necessarily object to having government contracts or using government subsidies, hell I do a lot of this as well, just seems like these companies shouldn't be the darlings that they are.""](http://www.wallstreetoasis.com/forums/elon-musk-companies-are-they-are-just-scams)

Hello from a cool morning in South Africa.

1) Will Solar City be attending IREC 2015 in Cape Town in October?

2) **Has Solar City considered roof top solar installations with a higher cost per kw/h or higher asymetrical metering as compared current solar farms**, if widespread job creation is created to meed goverment's target for reducing employment (currently at 25%)?

As stated, job creation is not in the manufacturing but in the installation. Currently goverment is accreding new electricians through their FET colleges but no means to employ them. Roof top represents a means to employ people nationally, where local community members are educated to install solar in their community, thereby stimulating local community job development. This is in contrast to community trusts which are set up for solar farms in the Northern Cape only, which does not benefit other areas.

3) Would you ever consider **financing a startup SA company which leverages this model**, given the unique political (ANC needs a conduit for sustainable job creation to stave off the EFF advance), **economic (recent downgrade from Baa1 to Baa2)**, social (nation wide blackouts have spurred the populace to invest in personal independent power production) and technological (low barrier to educate low skilled workers to do solar installations) factors?
