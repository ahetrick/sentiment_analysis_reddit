mfgmfg,819,"I met you 20 years ago last month in Redmond with a group of 5 other kids who won a ""Imagine the Magic"" contest about what the coolest computer could do. This was my essay entry:

>The coolest computer would be one that changes speech into words that I can see because I'm deaf. The computer should be powerful and portable. The microphone could be worn on my body or set on a table. It would have a heads-up display that projects words whenever someone speaks.

I'm curious if you remember this meeting - I'm to your right in this picture: http://www.proudlyserving.com/images/itm1995.jpg

1. Research shows kids on the autism spectrum learn more easily in 2D, presumably because of sensory and social issues.

2. Kinect is an interactive 2D gaming platform.

3. [Mind Reading](http://www.jkp.com/uk/mindreading/faq/) is a software suite/game developed by Cambridge University that uses a library of over 400 emotions to teach nonverbal social cues via videos of 6 actors' facial expressions, vocal examples, primitive video games and quizzes. The software is unfortunately now entirely out of date (I have a 2005 Mac I keep just to run it). 

The software has helped my son enormously. He learns the social cues by rote and it actually works for him. He can now tell when classmates are kidding, being mean or feeling uncomfortable, etc., etc., etc.  This after years of social group therapy didn't move the needle at all. What's more, he truly enjoys it.

Finally the question: Can Microsoft *please* work with Cambridge to incorporate this method of teaching with an interactive Kinect game that could possibly also read the facial and vocal cues of the player? 

I imagine children with autism working their way through a fictional land, meeting characters and gaining achievements/levels by correctly identifying and reacting to nonverbal social cues.

Your organization can make this happen and I know you have the heart for it, though it's not a primary mission of yours. 

If nothing else, can you purchase the software and update it to run on current systems. It's a tragedy this incredible resource is fading into obsolete tech oblivion.

lysergicfuneral,33,"Hi Bill,

With documentaries like Cowspiracy, Forks Over Knives, and Food Inc., the damage that animal agriculture causes to the environment and personal health is becoming more well-known. Livestock's impact on the environment rivals (or even exceeds) that of all forms of transportation combined. You have several posts about this [on your blog](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Future-of-Food). And as you pointed out, demand for meat and dairy will only increase in the developing world in the coming decades. You have also been influential in actions taken to work on climate change issues, notably and recently in Paris.

Someone with your influence could make a big difference in weaning the Western world off of meat and dairy and maybe, hopefully, setting the standard for the rest of the world. Renewable power, electric cars, and mass transit are all great, but changing one's diet cane make a bigger difference, right now, at no additional cost.

A few years ago, I saw that you and your wife went vegan. Are you still? Will you make reduction of meat and dairy one of the points of your climate discussion?

Thanks for everything you do, Bill."

I'm a teacher at a government school in Africa. I'm passionate about teaching kids to program and use technology to create solutions. I don't like seeing technology being used as a baby sitter.

We hear a lot about how educational technology will improve education standards, but I'm worried that gap between rich and poor is growing as access to the latest technology becomes more essential and more expensive. How do I open up future opportunities for my students, some of whom don't have a computer or Internet connection at home? Considering the pace of technological innovation, will the global south be left behind entirely?

P.S. I bought a Dash robot after reading Melinda's recommendation of it and I agree that it's a great tool to teach kids to program. Thanks for the recommendation!

You've gone from a poster child for hard core capitalism to being one of the world's great philanthropists. Are there any particular moments in your life that, whether through planting small seeds or torrential revelation, mark this change? Or moments that have made you see the world in a different light?

Thanks!"

derzky,5,"Mr. Gates,

Can society as a whole combat imperfect dissemination of information and, if so, how do you see this happening? Specific examples of what I mean by ‘imperfect dissemination of information’ are:

1. Russian media spreads specific information about the Syrian war (or any other issue). A U.S. media outlet offers a different (if not oftentimes conflicting) view of the same event/problem. Unanswered questions lead to confusion and more questions; yet, the news cycle starts anew, and new topics overshadow the previously unanswered ones.
2. Fox News says one thing about a Presidential Candidate; CNN offers a different opinion.

What I’m trying to get at is the fact that people have to make their own judgments based on conflicting and imperfect information. I believe that most misunderstandings, stereotypes, and prejudices arise from said imperfect understanding. This issue of imperfect/asymmetric information becomes increasingly complicated when state censorship, direct and indirect (via vague and easily misinterpreted laws), comes into play."

Though I find your effort to make their lives better more than justified, I'm wondering if investing in the not-so-extremely-poor could provide better results to society as a whole.

For example: 

A - if you spend 1000 dollars to feed a starving person, you save a life, but it's likely that person doesn't have the means to get out of its current situation and will starve again in the future.

B - if you spend 10K dollars on a poor student or graduate with good grades, and help to make him/her an entrepreneur/professional of some sort, you are kickstarting a business/family who can in turn contribute back to society.

Does your foundation work with anything similar to what I described in B, and what is the outcome, over the long term, on the lives of the extremely poor you are reaching to?"

Why so much emphasis on energy and time? :D 

Have you ever considered that certain african or south american tribes do not need the technology nor the notion of time that we have? 

Most of the people that live without the above are actually happy, content and have a really different perspective on life and time as we westerneers have. 

Do they need/want the change? it is our responsability to give it to them? Why do people always strive to make others think and be like them? If something is good or feels good for us, it does not automatically feel the same for somebody in different environment/culture.

I do agree that access to fresh water, cures for certain diseases and food is absolutely a human right and it should be available to everyone in the world. 

I also, do agree that energy could make their lives easier where it lacks, but not all the world needs it. 

We are much much wiser and the education system worldwide has improved in the past centuries, but this is from our own perspective and our own values. 

Our brains are filled with information and guidelines since our first years, do that, do this, get this, get a degree, get a job so you can afford to pay for your studies and your house/car, do we actually need all of this?

For context, I started a company with this goal. We have been designing systems for K-12 and higher education, between completely recreating how teachers and students interact, mostly through software (although we have designs for our own hardware as well), and then the system allows for students, the schools, and us to all make money off of students just going to school and taking the classes. We believe this will lead to schools being financially self-sustaining, and also having a good path for institutions of higher education being able to go tuition-free, while not relying on money from tax-payers to do it (although we totally support the government funding education). We also are working on the system being able to offer many, many more classes than some high schools cannot afford to, like gardening, auto-shop courses, clothing design, and better sex ed through better software design for schools."

I've brought my designs to Washington D.C., met with many regulatory agencies and legislators, and tried as much as I can to spread and share this information.  It is accepted in the developing world as a solution to many issues from poor burning practices, but has yet to make an impact in the ""first world"", and I am trying hard to change that.  I've been stymied by regulation, it is incredibly difficult for a small enterprise to bring products from regulated markets to market in developed nations.

My question is, what can we as a whole do to make it faster and easier for developing technology to get through the regulatory process and into the end users' hands where it can start making a difference?

Continuing that thought, what can a small business like mine do to access resources that can help ease entry into highly regulated, and thus with high financial barriers to entry, market?

I would greatly like to improve air quality and quality of life for as many people as possible, and I truly believe I have the means to do so if we could just get it out there.  I know I'm not the only one in this position.

Medical workers can be met with strong distrust, and even attacked as some believe doctors seek to harm them.

Pirsqed,1,"Hey Bill, 

Is there anything we can do to make entrepreneurship more available to people in developed countries? 

Starting a business that requires a physical location is very costly. (I've been looking at a place in the downtown Portland area, and renovations alone would be at least $400,000!) 

Even with a great business plan and $100,000 of my own money, it's hard to secure another $800,000 in funding. 

While many countries have great wealth, the vast majority of the population doesn't have access to that wealth. Banks are hesitant to loan to unproved ideas, while angel investors and venture capitalists are looking for a huge return on investment. 

This leaves a large middle ground of businesses that could expect a 200% return on investment in undeveloped and unproven fields. 

How can we improve access to funding and services for entrepreneurs?"

1.Considering all the amazing work that you have accomplished through the gates foundation, why have you not made it more accessible to residents of the nation you are trying to help?  

In many countries including India, is quite risky to provide volunteering services due to the sheer size of corporation that takes place in the country. I'm not trying to imply that your foundation is the only one that's trustworthy with time and money, however a great many people have faith in you, and your ideals, including myself and would love to have that opportunity more accessible to me by being able to volunteer or help directly. It's far to complicated right now! http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Jobs/Volunteering leads me nowhere where its easy and accessible to me.

laukkanen,1,"Mr. Gates,

First off, thank you for giving us your time!

A deep concern of mine is the pace at which humanity will automate a large percentage of the population out of jobs.  As machine intelligence progresses technology will be able to do a huge percentage of jobs humans can do, for cheaper, longer hours and more efficiently.  

This could essentially 'break' our societal status quo.  There are only so many 'creative' jobs out there, and people need to eat and put a roof over their heads.

What solutions do you see to keep mass unemployment from happening due to jobs being outsourced to machines? Or if it does occur and we, as mankind, embrace this transition, how would you envision it not having a detrimental impact to society as a whole.

I've spoken to many people who are inspired by your humanitarian efforts, and the changes you are working to bring in how we attack the major problems of the world.  The way that you have organized  people of intellectual and financial influence to contribute to your foundation's efforts is a small revolution.

My question:  How do we get government to stop the incessant infighting, and to take a longer view on solution of the many problems we face?  What do we need to do as voters to influence our leaders to create more long term plans for change in our society?  Our problems of poverty and damaged communities will take generations to solve, even with concerted effort in a single direction.  With the current political climate, any program implemented which might bear fruit in 10-15 years could never possibly survive that long, as it's a mission of the party in power to destroy any vestiges of the party it succeeded.

Thank you for doing this AMA! I read your letter and I found it very interesting. 

To me it seems that in order to avoid increasing our carbon footprint, we need to take our energy from a source not on the Earth: the Sun. However, solar panels are just not efficient enough at this point to be economically viable. What steps do you plan on taking to stimulate research and new ideas in this area? 

There is already a great amount of infrastructure set up for transporting, processing, and storing fossil fuels throughout the world. We need to use fossil fuels for some time while we do our best to transition to renewables in order to reduce our carbon footprint.

What is your view on using existing infrastructure (pipelines, storage tanks, etc.) to store energy (harvested from sources like wind and solar) in a liquid form? Do you think it will be feasible at some point?

Thank you again!

truemeliorist,1,"Hey Mr. Gates -

We are at a point of time where innovation is happening at an exponential scale. This is exciting, and kind of terrifying. In a pre-digital era, the law was consistently behind the technological curve, but it often caught up. But with exponential rates of innovation, the ""catching up"" part seems more and more elusive. The number of people qualified to really weigh in on the new niche technologies gets smaller and smaller, while the public often is usually given a barely-adequate summary by well-meaning but under-informed media. This leads to contentious, but extremely uninformed conversations happening, even in the halls of congress.

I have worked with Microsoft technologies for the past 20 years, obtaining my first MCSE accreditation in 1996-96 (Windows NT etc) and currently focus on cloud technologies with Office 365, primarily Sharepoint Online.

Over the years I have watched the shift from on-premise services to cloud based (and perhaps back and forward again!).

My question is this:

Do you see Microsoft supporting on premise services in the future, say 10 years?

How long before we see the demise of the tried and tested ""file and folder"" structure which we have all been using for years, in favour of the ""flat"" file storage system preferred by sharepoint?

I understand that your focus is less MS and more your philanthropic endeavors (which I appreciate and think is a most wonderful thing!) but hope you can shed some light on these questions!

My question is regarding space travel, and more specifically missions to Mars.

First of all - thanks for all that you're doing for this world.

I was in Omaha last May and was the smarty pants that shouted out ""Relax it's only Bill Gates!"" When all those Peruvian guys wanted to take a selfie with you outside Borsheims on the Sunday. I think I may have made you laugh (talk about an achievement of my lifetime).

My question revolved around critical thinking and thinking in terms of probabilities.

Warren has often said that he values people who take the same set on information and see things completely differently from other people.... Like Todd and Tedd he once said in an interview were those kinds of people.

How does one cultivate this way of rapidly looking at information and coming to a more through reasoning of a situation?

Second in terms of thinking in probabilities, does Warren say to invest in the highest expected value investment e.g. if there is 90% chance of losing money but a 10% chance of making 20x, would that be considered a good investment?

Also, I read Bob Rubin's book
, but was hoping you could guide me on something more 'meaty' on how to think in probabilities.

Much appreciated and thanks again.

There was an article published some time ago about [self-driving cars being ""programmed to kill""](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/542626/why-self-driving-cars-must-be-programmed-to-kill/).

The main point of the article is this:
> Here is the nature of the dilemma. Imagine that in the not-too-distant future, you own a self-driving car. One day, while you are driving along, an unfortunate set of events causes the car to head toward a crowd of 10 people crossing the road. It cannot stop in time but it can avoid killing 10 people by steering into a wall. However, this collision would kill you, the owner and occupant. What should it do?

People would understandably be hesitant to buy a car that could end up sacrificing their lives. How do you see companies solving this moral dilemma and convincing drivers to buy self-driving cars? What other obstacles do you see in the public adopting these cars?

I would argue that you're the most important innovator/public figure in history. I'm writing this because, wow, there's a chance that I can write to someone who's actually more influential than Einstein or anyone else people typically canonize.

You're also extremely powerful and you inspire the world because one of the most powerful people in the world chooses to focus on helping the most vulnerable and needy. While disease and food availability seem to be the biggest problems, can I say that I believe it's tribalism? I think the root of all our problems is the Us and Them syndrome and I hope to one day be a writer or someone influential so I can help the world act like we're all from the same tribe. I'd make sure we still eat different foods, though, cause food variety is awesome."

I recently spoke to the Dean of Electrical Engineering at UNT about the education I'm currently receiving.

The courses seem rushed and very disorganized. His response was that the curriculum is designed to ensure students can get a job as soon as they graduate. He did not explicitly say that it's actually designed to teach students. I imagine his response does please many students (especially those who have accrued student debt) but for someone like myself who hasn't had to pay for college (GI BILL) I felt really disheartened by his response.

Given how chaotic politics is and how little gets done , do you think it would be better to have the world run by an AI?

 One that makes decisions based on statistics that it alone collects. One that is programmed to find peaceful solutions. Such a system would supersede the traditional bipartisan drudgery of US politics. It could allocate resources appropriately, and wouldn't demonise minority groups because of stereotypes. An AI can not be bribed by lobbyists or deny the existence of climate change. 

Do you think this system would be better for humanity and the planet itself in the Long Run? "

No matter how much money you continue to dump on top of fires, you will never accomplish any lasting change until you fix corruption.

**It is painfully obvious that the most destructive force in the world is the American government.**

My question is, why don't you dump money into solving corruption? I'm not talking about pissing away money on a political candidate who would be hamstrung once in office, but actually solving corruption with meaningful changes.

Organizations like https://represent.us http://www.fairvote.org and https://mayday.us have been making *real* progress on this front.

With some of your money, why not fund an open source version of online government and completely change the world?

I have no delusions you will answer this, much less fund it. I'm going to develop this technology with or without you. It'd just be a lot faster if I had a team of political scientists, philosophers, security experts, and developers working on it as well.

Your foundation focuses a lot on testing in K-12 education system. But I've seem a lot of criticism about it. Sorry don't have the source but the most cogent criticism I've seen is how even though you are a very strong advocate of stronger testing, the schools your own children have gone to, have been anything but focused on tests and college-readiness. Can you share your thoughts on the topic?

Along the same lines. I'm a resident of Texas, and here schools are funded by districts. Something that works very well with institutional racism. In fact not only does it ensure the rich neighborhoods get the most funds and the poor neighborhoods get the least funds, it also strongly incentivizes the well-off to live as far away from the poor decreasing the economic opportunities to the poor by being in the same neighborhoods as the wealthy.

DDLongLegs,1,"Mr. Gates

There have many that have criticized the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the donations and investments it makes for not being ""effective altruism."" Your foundation has offered tens of millions in non-repayable grants to some of the world’s largest corporations, including Mastercard and Scholastic. 

Do you think that that these donations gives credence to the claims that the foundation is a way to help boost your public appearance, create a large tax write-off for corporate investments, while doing very little for the people you have set out to help?"

LadyPerceptive,1,"Mr Gates, 
I'm a graduate student in a STEM field, and throughout my post-graduate career I have been disappointed in the lack of collaboration within and among universities. I find what other fields are doing fascinating and I'm also constantly thinking ""What we do in our lab could help you!"" However the constant fear of intellectual property theft, dishonesty, and plagiarism in academics is far greater than the willingness to work together. Even having to pay for educational journals on the dissemination of knowledge seems ironic. How can we address these things at a university level? "

InternetPunkMachine,1,"Hey Mr. Gates, I was wondering what your thoughts are on this AI intelligence question.

The point at which AI super intelligence surpasses human intelligence will be a huge step in our evolution as a species. 

Brains are flawed and our species dies. Machines do not have to. If an  AI intelligence was programmed with emotions like humans experience, it would be hard to actually differentiate between what makes us human. If machines have our emotion and our intelligence they become an extension of our species just with far more capabilities. 

My question is, do you think machines with programmed emotions should be tried at? 

This would need caution, obviously. But ultimately the machine could carry human mindset farther than humans can actually live. This can be a great thing, no?"

I have two questions if you don't mind. I am a band teacher in upstate NY, and my first question is, have you ever played an instrument yourself?

My second question: Science proves a great deal more cognitive development in children/young adults that take band in school. That being said, and in a time where we are desperately looking for ways to improve academic achievement among our kids, why are the arts not advocated for more? The difference in test results and brain development among musicians is drastically higher according to research, so it boggles my mind that the government cuts funding to band/chorus."

Particularly with how long a plant takes to build.  Say a nuclear plant starts being discussed in 2023, building starts 2028, commercial power production starts 2038, but a decade later, before the plant's even paid for half it's cost, the DEMO fusion reactor starts up.  5-10 years later a fleet of fusion plants could be built

Not sure how much you know about our tiny little country, but to not extend the question too long, my general concern is that as a country we are starting to lose ground as an economy and I am afraid of the future that could behold us. All the signs of a mortgage bubble pop are present. Manufactures and other investors are leaving the country. Prices even for local products are ever inflating while salaries are stagnant (eg: Local brand milk/icecream is more expensive than same brand in our neighbor Panama).

What is your view on the existential implications of artificial intelligence that other prominent figures in the fields of science and technology, such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, have vocalized?

Nazario3,1,"Mr. Gates, thank you for doing this again.

I am slightly worried about the future of the internet and the way it is used by people to connect. The internet is supposed to help educating people. But I feel like it often times reinforces conflicts and ignorance. For example, many people use Facebook as one of their primary means to connect to the world, to read news and to shape their view of the world.
But when you read discussions between people on controversial topics it seems that they just seek confirmation for beliefs already held. Here in Europe there is a whole lot of discussion about problems concerning the refugee crisis and often times the most visible contributions are rather extremist in one direction or the other, reasonal comments get burried. I observed the same on topics that have to do with the India / Pakistan conflict or Israel / Palestine matters e.g. on the BBC page. Writing an educated comment after checking the facts and actually thinking about a problem does take longer than blurting out a rather unsophisticated reply after all.

Although I am not aware of any actual studies on that matter I've read articles arguing along the same lines.

Do you see that as a problem as well? If so, do you think society is aware of the problem and what do you think can be done about it? (I think compared to the upvoting-system on Facebook, reddit's system does a better job here)"

What do you think of recent criticisms that say we don't need an ""energy miracle""? I'm worried that people who see the ""energy miracle"" headline will assume that we shouldn't start rolling out renewable energy because it isn't ready yet, while many scientists and economists are saying that it is ready.

As you yourself once said:

> That is, as more machines would sell, it created the market for a broader range of software, and that further drove the market for the machines, and in fact that volume allowed the price of the machine to come down... 

>The large machines we use today, and the big server farms, or corporate data servers, these are all based on the Windows PC architecture which, because of its volume, has come down in price, and improved in performance very, very dramatically. And so we have a large software industry.

If rolling out huge volumes of PCs worked for the computing industry, why doesn't a huge rollout work for the clean energy industry?

I'm not against clean energy research, or ""moonshot"" research projects, but I think it should be coupled with actual experience in rolling out clean energy technologies that exist today."

finnerpeace,1,"Hi Mr Gates! Bellevue mom here, involved with our local education system and the gifted program. :) 

I'm sure you and Melinda have noticed that a desperate need in improving the world is in improving human interactions, education, psychology, integrity, etc. 

All the tech in the world won't fix psychosis, irresponsible parenting, abuse, substance abuse, violence, prejudice, the inability to collaborate and negotiate, corruption, lack of compassion and respect, ignorance, etc. Basically all the diseases of the human mind and heart, which seem to be the origin for a great many of our outward sufferings.

In all the focus in developing our greatest minds and efforts to serve humanity and prepare it for a better future, it seems way, way, WAY too little of this focus is going where it needs to on these things: in treating and educating the human spirit. Education, family life, psychology, negotiation, conflict mediation: all the essentials of a healthy society and of peace-building. Almost none of the students I talk to are interested in these fields: they all want to program or get rich. And almost none of their coursework deals with this, while they DO have a lot of science and very advanced math which they may never use again.

I'm starting to blame all the STEM focus. Soon we will have societies that can create holograms but not healthy families or negotiate to save our own Earth or stop killing each other. Please help! 

What have you and Melinda found intriguing to help these so essential-but-overlooked services thrive, here in the US and worldwide?

Thank you for your time. I find it increasingly frustrating that it takes a billionaire to create common sense change. Energy and water are going to be the hot button issues of future generations. But most importantly, I would argue, that global internet access is of the utmost importance. Knowledge is power and creating a global network with access points for all of the globe would derive tangible social change that would be evident in all of the world's living rooms. Rather than dropping millions of dollars in munitions and bombs on Afghanistan/Iraq there should have been facebook installed in every house to give the people of these countries first hand insight into other social norms - change would have been derived from within.

 I understand That you have made major investments in clean energy.

The polywell has the potential to operate under a so called ""high beta"" regime; achieving a high ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic field pressure. This has the potential to allow the creation of a relatively small (and therefore low cost ) fusion reactor.  If it works, and at this point it is far from certain it will, it could be a kind of silver bullet for climate change.

Your charities always seem to be about helping people (global development, health, etc...).  

That's great and all, but all of those things increase human population - and over-population is the cause of almost everything that's wrong on Earth right now.

So, despite your best intentions, your charities are actually making a lot of things worse (by adding more and more humans to our planet).  The charities are making things better (for a small group of humans), while making things worse for the environment/planet/animals.

At one point we visited a small community of pottery makers, who would make pottery and walk to the village and sell it for food. If the pottery didnt cook right, they would go hungry.

We wanted to help if we could and asked what they would want to help. Their answer was a surprise - they said they would love to have a small bike, so that they could drive the pottery to the village to sell, instead of walking the 8km's to town and back each day. This makes sense, and would be a single thing that would help a whole community.

When we returned to Canada, we wanted to raise funds but unfortunately the idea fell through. I've never forgotten the elder man's face light up when speaking of the dream of owing a small bike, and I know he is still walking to town each day :(

I've felt guilty ever since and really do want to help.

I know a lot of people ask you for money, but considering how your Foundation tries to help many people with single initiatives, I am asking if your foundation may consider funding the bike for the village, and further, if you would fund further projects in similar nature?

I would love to travel the world and help villages in similar manners. I believe micro level donations like these can make powerful impacts for whole communities. I would be willing to volunteer my time for such an endeavor, but I need the funds to distribute. 

I (and many people) no longer believe in some ""charities"" that purporte to help the poor while 80% of funds raised go to the organization. This is why I believe direct micro help like the example above would be much more beneficial.

Would you consider funding such an initiative? I can promise complete transparency if so.

Thank you for your time."

Huystuhh,1,"Hey Bill! Hope you're having a great day. 

I studied Computer Science in college and am currently working a Software Development job at a big tech company. From a STEM perspective I think AI and smarter machines will be a huge boon for humanity as a whole, but I'm extremely frightened with the potential of how tough the growing pains will be for our society. 

With the rising tide of machines that will eventually replace a lot of human jobs, what do you think would be the best course of action that we as a society can do to mitigate this realistically? And what jobs do you think will always (or at least long into the future? be done by humans? 

Thanks Bill! "

Extra Bonus Question: As a 12 year old, I wrote you a letter for a class project explaining how you were my hero and asking how to get a job at Microsoft (everyone in class had to write to our idols and ask them how they got to where they were).

A criticism I have heard of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is only focused on ""sexy"" altruistic goals, ones where there is an immediate impact that can be shown to investors, instead of goals that address the underlying cause of the issues.

How do you respond to this?"

How familiar are you with the Red Line project in Baltimore City? Would you be willing and able to put together some kind of coalition to get it going?

It's a project that has been in the planning stages for decades. When the ball was finally moving on it, and the state had federal money lined up, it was sacrificed by the new Maryland governor to move funds to transportation projects around the state, literally cutting the city out of the budget. Its an issue that addresses the plight of West Baltimore, an area that rarely if ever sees positive events.

I only bring this up because West Baltimore was once a vibrant part of the city, and no one seems able or willing to try and revitalize the area.

synthetico,1,"Mr. Gates,

Academic research in the US is in trouble. Talented young scientists are leaving research after becoming disillusioned with the field. Here are some issues that drive scientists away from research: negative data are not publishable, and therefore do not help secure grants or employment; rewards are not given based on the quality of the work but on storytelling ability, splashiness and trendiness of the findings; competition between labs wastes funds and efforts - rather than synergize, researchers opt to compete and often use unscrupulous means to gain an advantage over their competitors; scientists are protective of animal models and data (including clinical data) - by refusing to share these resources, they prevent others from making advancements in the field; etc. While this model works for business, it doesn't work for science - especially not for academic science. It results in burnout and drives away talented young researchers. Ultimately, this model impedes progress.


I think science would benefit from establishing research consortia across academic institutes and placing less emphasis on individuals. Such institutions would help retain talent and refocus their attention on the subject matter. I know similar institutions exist, but they need to become the norm - not the exception. Also, many existing consortia work poorly because their members seldom abandon their habits.

Can you think of a way to realize this multi-institutional, collaborative approach to research, and have it become a functioning norm?

Btw, thanks for everything you fund and do."

We have the ability to provide this *free to all people around the world.

I think of it as combining Reddit, Wikipedia, surveymonkey (easy access low level programming) and a spider web for the structure. Access via periodical updates for those unable to connect to the internet. We have the ability to do this now. Education is, as you know, the best predictor of population growth.

What advice can you give me about staying motivated despite depression and pursuing my education despite low income and drive? 

I got the highest SAT in my graduating class but have not attended college because of a lack of funds and inability to find the drive in me to get over the hump due to low self-esteem, depression and addiction. What advice would you give to people struggling with addiction? Specifically in my case marijuana.

I'm a 22 year old who is currently working in R&D in the industrial/specialty adhesive industry as a lab tech developing new adhesives to make production in many fields more lightweight, cost effective and easier in automotive, marine, medical and other industries. I started as a manufacturering employee but soon proved to be too intelligent for my job. The company I work for is family owned and operated out of Newington, CT. I'm struggling with depression after a multiple year relationship I've had for most of my teenage and adult life has come to an end. I'm looking to stop making excuses and kick start my life but every time I start to feel motivated or optimistic I get sucked back into depression and feel hopeless. I know I have more to offer the world and I want to fulfill my potential."

I am deeply thankful for you recent work with Mission Innovation to help stave off a potentially dark future due to climate change. 

However, I would like to know why your main focus is on renewable energy. Because we have already dumped massive amounts of CO2 into the air that will remain there for millennia to come, why are we not investing in AIR CAPTURE technology (not carbon capture), to take CO2 directly out of the air? I understand that air capture is expensive, but this is the survival of the planet we are talking about, and if the strategy is to make a massive investment, why aren't we trying to take the CO2 directly out of the air?

Also, will Mission Innovation seek to fund adaptive technology design, for example innovation in rain water capture and storage infrastructure? I ask because, as you know, while we are executing mitigation strategies, soon will will be up to our neck in adaptation problems.

Do you think that when it comes to AI, China may be (potentially creating great risk) on the cutting edge? Not purely computer related, but at the level of their cell research. A hybrid (human cells to grow a brain with a direct machine interface) could be the first AI and given the (lack of) level of ethics in China, don't you think this could be a threat.

It seems that factoring in the rate of genomics research, a bio/hybrid AI would arrive before a purely electronic one. See for example BGI in Shenzhen."

tons0phun,1,"Robotics is going to have a big impact on the world soon, it already has in things such as military operations, search and rescue, manufacturing, and more. Soon it will have a major impact on other forms of service and labor (driverless taxis/trucks, [food industry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_gxLKSsSIE), home service), and even more influence in the places in which it already exists.


In a serious connotation, there is a possibility in this century to see such a thing as an entire division of autonomous military drone systems with swarm coordination, the displacement of tens or possibly hundreds of thousands from service and labor, and other unimagined applications which while providing the benefit of automation introduce ethical risks on scales which we may not completely comprehend yet.


So to the main question: our foresight as humans is extremely limited, and emerging technology has had a history of not being regulated or checked until it has already caused damage. Given the propensity of robotics to have this same future, what would your thoughts be on the idea of making [Asimov's 3 Laws of Robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics) real national+international law?


That is to say that, instead of letting development go unrestricted until there is an offense and what is done cannot be undone, the laws would be setup to restrict development and deployment until it can be shown that the machine will have a net-benefit to humankind. Yes, I realize that it could ""slow down progress"", but is such fast progress really worth the damage this could do in both dollars and lives?

It's my firm belief that your security is only as good as your weakest employee in the company at this point. Is there anything you can see that will mitigate these in the future and the role encryption, open-source adoption and peer reviews will take in the upcoming years?

Beatut,1,"Hello Mr. Gates, you mentioned in an answer about feeling powerless towards terrorists. I was reading also once that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have cost the US more than 3 trillion dollars. If this money would not have been spent in wars in those countries, but rather as investments in those countries, would there still be a considerable amount of miserable people in those countries who would be potential terrorists?       
So the real question is with crazy amounts that the military spends, that usually lead in disaster, chaos, and even more terrorism, wouldn't we be more successful if we used that money to create happy and friendly people?

Epiclouder,1,"Hey there, Bill!

I moved up here into Seattle about 27 years ago right around the time Microsoft was really taking off. Before the 80s happened, Seattle was kind of a backwater place with an economy trying to recover from a very long drawn-out recession caused mainly by Boeing. The outlook was quite similar to Midwestern cities still existing today with the backlash of high unemployment. You guys came in and turned blue-collar jobs into white-collared ones, helped fix the economy greatly and really cleaned the city up. With the advent of Microsoft, more technological industries moved in and Seattle became a boomtown for engineers, programmers, network admin, etc. 

One of the few drawbacks however is homelessness, which has skyrocketed to record levels recently. A lot of fingers have been pointed at large companies like Amazon and Microsoft bringing in new young kids to code, program and do IT work, which has priced many people out of neighborhoods that used to be lower-middle class or less. One of the city's historically predominantly black neighborhoods is now sitting at a 20% black population due to gentrification.

You've always been an advocate for college as far as I've seen, and I was wondering what your opinion was on the current costs of it. I've seen a lot of people go hundreds of thousands of dollars into debt for it, which is absolutely insane considering that to even get a relatively good job these days you're basically *required* to do it.

I'm lucky in that I live relatively close to one of the better community colleges in the country - I'm taking a full course load and working close to full time so I can cover the costs of college, my car, and just being able to eat and stay warm (it adds up to roughly $12k a year in income, but pretty much no savings or anything). I'm better off than *most* people when it comes to college, but that means going through the stress of having so many things to do and nowhere near enough time, as I basically wake up at 8am, go to college, get home at 9pm, do homework until 1-2am, and repeat. 

I'm not the only one in this situation - I personally know another few dozen people who I either work with or have classes with doing the exact same problems. This is an absolutely massive problem and I think it's part of the reason that stress levels and suicide rates are so high among that age group. There's no way to ""win"" here, you either get *lucky* and go through extraordinary stress and have literally a couple of hours of free time a week (if you can even manage to graduate when you've got so little time to devote to studying) while simultaneously barely being able to afford food and shelter, or you go through the average path and manage to go through college with a guaranteed place to stay and food but graduate in amounts of debt that you have to devote even more time trying to handle.

1. Do you think we will finally concentrate on space travel and exploration in the upcoming decade or so?

2. What are your thoughts about religion? I know you said that you're Catholic in the past. I am an atheist and I come from a religious background. I understand the practical need for religion, but don't you ever ask yourself: ""does the cookie monster really exist?"".

Would it be possible to build water desalination plants on the coasts of Africa to be piped to all the African nations and distributed to the public equally would that help end the massive starvation events that happen to the villages and help eliminate the fighting between the tribes over resources? I am poor but I know I can make it. When I see the children on tv over there it breaks my heart. What can we do? I know they cost alot of money and logistics of such a project would be enormous but I think it's worth if it saves a child or empowers the people over there to change. Obviously it can't be done alone but I think it's worth trying any thoughts on it? Since you were there helping with the vaccination programs your efforts have saved lives.

I mean, I know that this technology basically exists because of your foundation, but why not make it the focus instead of an also-ran? Ditch the net programs, dump the genetically-altered sterile mosquito plan, and simply genocide the vector? You could blanket one corner of the Earth after another, with overlapping zones and re-sweeps, and you don't have to worry about compliance, you don't have to worry about educating the local populace, you don't have to worry about genetic mutation, you just have to clean up mosquito corpses.If we physically murder the entire species vector, we no longer have to worry about the toll malaria takes on the population, nor treatment, nor prevention, nor mutation.

Malaria just...gone. 

I don't think you'd have to spend much more than we are now, either, if you do a cost breakdown of the other strategies and the treatment, much less the human toll.

Some questions pertaining to the InfoSec realm. 

What are you're thoughts around Kerberos attacks and are there any plans to better protect against them or finding ways to mitigate them entirely. I know a lot of organizations are not following proper security guidelines due to the balance of security and operations.

Do you have any thoughts on the solutions like Avecto, Viewfinity (now CyberArk), and Beyond Trust that aim to better control elevated rights and grant on demand privilege to standard accounts? We all know admin accounts are convenient, but not easily secured and easy to abuse. The native handling of Windows Standard user vs Admin users are not operationally efficient for many organizations without another solution's aid.

Thank you!"

pixie_beeble,1,"Hi Mr. Gates,

I am a 29 year old from Australia. In my early to mid teens, and my younger brothers early years, my mother printed out 'your' 14 rules for kids that they won't learn in school. I am reasonably sure that she tacked on a few of her own at the end, but I digress. These rules had a profound effect on me. They were printed and placed on the wall directly above our PC so that we could see it each day. I am wondering, did you actually say these words? If so, I thank you, very much. I was living on my own for the most part (I took a copy of these rules with me), and working whilst at high school. I believe I had a good work ethic from day dot, with no sense of entitlement and these words have stuck with me throughout my adult life.

Thank you :)

But other people with ""Microsoft Money"", like Paul Allen for example spend theirs in ways that some would consider down right harmful to people or the environment. For one example, Allen, Bloomberg, and a couple other billionaires are ~~supporting~~ solely funding very draconian gun control measures, buying voter initiatives, manipulating media. Measures that can cost lives, although of course the stated intention is opposite.

What do you believe are the root causes and what would you, as a person belonging to the top 0,1% in a country that many find as a prime example of a capitalistic system, suggest to do about it?

I really wish common problems were highlighted in a more comprehensive manner. Where should I go after VBA? Why can't I record VBA in Microsoft Access. Why can't I just drag and drop to copy and paste sheets / workbooks and get the code written for me (yes I'm aware of recording, but I want something that always works). I work with IBM software sometimes too. Is there a way to connect to outside software with VBA? I've also worked with Toad for Oracle. Why can't access run PLSQL? I find that language much more useful than SQL. Why can't I do a select statement with Docmd in VBA in access (I only ask because I couldn't run a union). Also, why can't I do a union in excel? Data relationships are easy for me to do, but I run into stonewalls when other people need to look at it. Instead of jumping through hoops with loops, couldn't a simple function address this shortcoming? Also, I worked with Tableau.

This would open up resources where it isn't at the moment and funding wars would no longer be a major source of transaction which could possibly lead to greater scientific discoveries and benchmarks alongside space exploration & aid the search for the current-ultimate renewable energy ie: fusion/dyson

2. **What are your thoughts on Ethnicity, Religion & Tradition and its stopping  power on the development of medical research? Does it seem as if humans hold too dearly to certain values which impedes progress in the field and not look beyond their lifespans?** and if so should efforts be placed forward to curb such obstacles to the development and betterment of humans as a species beyond its maximum lifespan?

3. **With the growth of AI and Aid-Bots within this decade alone, what are your thoughts on simulating life on Mars through developing a Life-Like,Life-Sustaining model of robots before attempts at terraforming and colonization of Mars through humans?** Such robots may also be able to initiate very basic greenhouse gasses efforts one would assume?

4. **Due to the lack of support within the country** *(not in monetary terms but in interest)* **would it be possible to forward you or your representatives sketches and paperworks on a multi-harvest energy generating system?**

People seem to hold on to negative experiences a lot more than positive ones, such as a simple bug among perfect, stable software, and end up hating said software because of that one simple bug. What have you tried to do, if anything, to prevent people from despising your products and giving them the best experiences possible?

After posting the above I realized that stereotypes can have a positive side as well, and your company might have a whole bunch of people praising it for something that isn't there.

Achievable by altering the world-views/mind sets of all the people in the world. In brief, it can be demonstrated that humanity is currently bamboozled by the ’mind mirror’. An effect similar to a primate gazing at a reflective surface. In that it may believe that what it is viewing is real. Just as humans place trust in what their untested brain tells them.

I’m currently studying biology in the UK, I’ve always been passionate about research in human disease and I’m planning on doing a research based masters in developing and studying drug resistant plasmodium next year. I’ve wanted to help with the fight against malaria for a long time now. I’ve heard that 50% of the funding is from you and 50% from the UK government. I was wondering how much progress do you predict this funding is going to make and what circumstances would potentially qualify further funding?

My second question again based on malaria, is how much are you still actively engaged in managing the effort and resource allocation towards preventative treatment and therapies in afflicted countries? I recall a few years ago seeing a video of you out with teams of people in these countries overseeing how things were going and it was very inspiring to see someone putting so much of their life and attention into what I consider a very important issue. 

I’m a huge fan and you’ve really inspired me to push myself to be the best I can be to hopefully one day have an impact on global health.

Many thanks for the AMA,

Snapfoot,1,"Mr. Gates, I saw this comment the other day and was wondering what you think of it:

""Bill Gates was a ruthless, cutthroat businessman who made his vast wealth by using every dirty trick in the book (and inventing a few new dirty tricks along the way) and then using Microsoft's success to effectively hold the computer industry hostage for 20 years.
He viewed any successful non-Microsoft software as a threat, even if that software was for Windows. And if that software was cross-platform he viewed it as an existential threat, since it lessened people's dependence on Microsoft.
Internet Explorer? Microsoft didn't make it. They completely missed the boat on the World Wide Web, and with the popularity of the Netscape Navigator web browser (which was available on almost every computer, from $20k SGI workstations to Macs to Windows PCs), Bill Gates & co saw a threat to Microsoft's dominance, so they rushed to get their own web browser by buying one from a company called Spyglass Software. Now, since Netscape Navigator cost money, everyone assumed Microsoft would charge for Internet Explorer, and Microsoft's contract with Spyglass Software promised to give Spyglass a cut of whatever money they made from Internet Explorer sales. So what did Microsoft do? They released Internet Explorer for free, which was something none of their competitors could do since Microsoft had such deep pockets. Spyglass Software was ruined, and so was Netscape eventually. Once Internet Explorer was available, Microsoft threatened not to sell Windows to any PC manufacturer that bundled Netscape Navigator, which would later get them in trouble with the Department of Justice and the EU.
DirectX? Began life as an OpenGL knock-off that would (Microsoft hoped) lock-in developers to Windows. Hell, Microsoft was so afraid of OpenGL (since it was cross platform and the industry standard at the time) that they offered to partner with SGI (creator of OpenGL) on a new, cross platform graphics library called FireGL. Except that Microsoft had no intention of actually releasing FireGL. They hoped working on FireGL would distract SGI from advancing OpenGL long enough to let DirectX (then called Direct3D) catch up to it, and when their plan worked Microsoft just up and abandoned FireGL.
When 3D accelerators were new (which are now called GPUs), there was a much larger number of companies developing desktop GPUs than the nVidia/AMD/Intel tri-opoly we have today, and many of them were too small to afford to create their own full OpenGL implementations. Since most PC GPUs at the time only implemented a small subset of OpenGL in hardware, Microsoft wrote a full software OpenGL implementation and then offered it to GPU companies, so those companies could just replace the parts that their GPU implemented in hardware and still have a full OpenGL driver. Once they had all spent a good deal of time doing this, Microsoft actually refused to license any of their OpenGL code for release, effectively guaranteeing that smaller GPU companies would only have support for DirectX.
Video For Windows? VFW (now called Windows Media or whatever) only came into being because Microsoft literally stole the source code to QuickTime For Windows. Both Microsoft and Intel were having a hard time getting video to play smoothly on PCs, when Apple surprised them both by releasing QuickTime For Windows, a port of their QuickTime video framework for Macintosh. QuickTime For Windows could to smooth video playback on ordinary PCs with no special hardware, and Microsoft and Intel were caught completely off guard by it. Apple had contracted out to a 3rd party company to do the Windows port of QuickTime, so what did MS do? They went to the same company and gave them a ton of money to develop Video For Windows, but an insanely short schedule, knowing full well that the company would essentially have to re-use a lot of the QuickTime For Windows source code to get the project done on time.
When Apple found out (their contract with the other company stated that Apple owned all the QuickTime For Windows source code), they went ballistic and sued Microsoft. Microsoft had been caught red-handed and knew that Apple had them by the balls. So MS settled. Remember when Microsoft ""bailed out"" Apple in the 90s by buying $150 million in Apple stock? Despite what the tech press reported, that's not what actually happened. The $150 million in non-voting Apple stock that Microsoft bought was part of their settlement (Apple was no longer on the verge of bankruptcy by that point, and didn't need to be bailed out). The settlement also had Microsoft agreeing to port MS Office and Internet Explorer to Macintosh.
So a lot of people my age tend to view Bill Gates' recent charities as an attempt to whitewash his reputation and, in a way, buy his way into heaven.""

While we're working to invent a clean, cheap source of energy, many of their lives will continue to stagnate, with high levels of unemployment and poor education, especially for girls. At the same time, mobile phones will show them how far behind the rest of the world they really are. A likely result is the kind of unrest that angry, young people often resort to.

I'm french and I live in france. A school named 42 opened at Paris and another one named Holberton School opened at SF. They let us learn and practice code programming with a high level for free.

The problem is that too many schools are expensive, they prevent a lot of incredible people to get that education.

Do you think that teaching and access to educations need some changes ?

Thank you. "
come_in_ski,0,"Hi Bill,

Thanks a lot for doing another AMA. My questions here involves the work you're doing to help decarbonize energy systems and usher in environmental sustainability.

1. Nuclear power - I've seen your TED talks and other speeches about reintroducing nuclear power as a major source of energy across the US. I know that you have a very [strong interest](http://terrapower.com/) in this, and I agree fully that nuclear power can be a large, complementary part of the global energy solution. However, the regulatory hurdles are very high, particularly since wind and solar are so cheap right now. Do you see Gen IV and future nuclear reactors being popularized in the US and elsewhere?

2. A few years ago, Microsoft went fully ""carbon neutral"" - what exactly does this entail? Using only clean energy and energy efficient building materials/designs in offices? Purchasing protected forest land? Volunteer programs for MS employees to work in conservation?

3. Do you see the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation divesting from fossil fuel investments anytime soon? The argument on both sides is very interesting, but I'd like to hear your take on it.

Thanks for all the work you do. Nice photo btw, where did you get your hat? :)"

Many are concerned about income inequality. I personally believe that if those at the top are able to efficiently allocate a portion of their resources for the benefit of all there is no issue. However, it's readily apparent that not everyone who accumulates immense wealth welcomes the responsibility to make a positive impact on the world, such as you and Melinda do. I am not in favor of wealth distribution, but I do believe those that hold a significant portion of the world's monetary resources have a responsibility to use at least some of those resources for good. Do you see any paths towards promoting responsible philanthropy that don't involve wealth distribution or significant government interference? I have a lot of works that would describe the federal government, and efficient is not among them.

TheWanderingSuperman,-1,"Hi Bill, 

It is easy to see the amount of impact a billionaire such as yourself can have on the world, whether for good or bad; but, in what ways are you *limited* by your riches.

Put another way: what are some things I can do to change the world that you *can't* do?

(The goal of this question, of course, is to say: Hey, Billionaire Bill can cure Malaria; but he can't do _____ as that is a *big* and *important* job far better performed by millions of people.)

Thanks!"

Thank you for your time."
frankiezoo,-1,"Hey Bill! I love the work you and Melinda do and I love the trend you two set for the altruistic billionaire movement! Now, you guys focus on a lot of issues that need a lifetime to poke around in and learn, like women's role in developing countries, disease control, and recently renewable energy. 

How did you hire your chairs and foundation leads? How did you know to trust these people and what did you look for in them?

It seems like a huge investment, in money and potential, to put your faith in these people so I assume you took great care to hire the best."
