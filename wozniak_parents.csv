Hey Steve! I saw you speak in Orlando at the ASI Show last year. As a fan of Apple and moderator of /r/apple, I really enjoyed hearing about your personal relationship with Steve Jobs and how you were such a driving force behind the birth of the personal computer. Naturally, I was very disappointed at how little time you had on stage, so I’m really looking forward to this AMA so I can hear more! So here’s my chance to ask you the question I wanted to ask back then. Given that it’s been about 10 years since the first iPhone, it makes you wonder what smartphones will be like in another 10 years. Where do you see smartphones going in the next decade? At this point, new features seem to be somewhat minor, so I’m wondering if you have any insight on what form factors or major hardware features we might see in the not-so-necessarily-near future. Also, what kind of apple are you eating? Thanks so much for doing this AMA!	|	[Here](	https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4apj5f/im_apple_cofounder_steve_wozniak_ask_me_anything/d12e4jz?context=3	)

Tech co's continue to be one of the worst polluters on the planet, which also means they are able to make a significant difference if they changed their ways. This process has to start at the design stages of new tech. In short, recycling co's will never have real success unless the products they process are manufactured with recycling in mind.

I'm not talking about figureheads or anything, I'm curious which person who you actually interacted with.

For me, my CS teacher had a huge influence on my development.  I had never considered computers much before that point (poor family, I only had a VIC-20 at home until I went to college in 1998) but my CS teacher recognized that I had a natural affinity for programming and helped me down that path.  I ultimately went to post-secondary for that and have now worked as a programmer in the games industry for over 10 years.  We've kept in touch, something that I find surprisingly rewarding."

You've personally seen Apple very closely both before and after Jobs. Jobs was the pioneer under whom Apple made some really ground-breaking products that changed the market completely while the post-Jobsian era Apple has been on a little lukewarm side in terms of such finesse/innovation, in my opinion. Case in point, the Apple Watch: Solid product with impressive design and functionality, yet a not-so market changing product. Software quality has also gone down a bit, like the maintenance of Mac App Store or troublesome iOS releases (performance issues). This is coming from a huge Apple fan.

Apple used to be one of the most inotive companies around, but I feel now they are charging way too much for tech that isn't as good as a PC/Hackintosh could be at the same price. I remember seeing a photo to the other day of the old apple logo saying ""Does more, for less"" and I feel now that it does less for more. "

thePurpleAvenger,1,"Hi Steve,

I've really enjoyed OS X since its debut, especially due its foundations as a Unix system. Being able to use its command line functionality for work while keeping the ease of use with more fun applications has been a godsend. 

With that said I've noticed that later versions of the OS have moved more towards an app-based environment, something similar to iOS. For me personally this has been disruptive because of differences in how the OS deals with its Unix side. For example, it is easier for me to set environmental variables for BibTeX in Windows 10 than it is in OS 10.10. I feel it shouldn't be this way, but this is of course only my personal opinion.

What are your thoughts on the shift of OS X towards more of an app-based environment?

Cheers!

P.S.
I'm a huge fan; our first family computer was a Macintosh and I've used one about every day since the early 90's :)."

jballanc,1,"Hey Woz! We actually met a number of years ago when I was working at the Fifth Avenue Apple Store. I was just a lowly salesperson then, helping you with a replacement 17"" MBP, but we chatted about lasers and your Nixie Tube watch and German vs Japanese cars. Well, after that I actually made it to Cupertino and worked as an engineer on the OS X server team. As much fun as that was, I eventually left because my wife, who is Turkish, and I wanted to move closer to her family before we had kids.

So I'm sitting here in Turkey, working (remotely) as a software engineer still, and I have to say that the experience has been amazing. The Turks are amazingly creative and inventive in general. It's a place full of ""natural hackers"" but, while the software industry here is growing at a crazy pace, there are obviously unique hurdles to overcome.

Have you had a chance to travel many different places outside the US and visit with their engineers, programmers, and entrepreneurs? What advice would you give to those trying to bootstrap new ""Silicon Valley""s outside of the US?

While most of these technologies don't give a very significant benefit to the ""cyborg"", these enhancements are only the beginning. 

Do you have any concerns for a future where the rich would be able to make themselves far superior to the poor through these device? How should the government factor into all of this? Should they regulate these? Does the amount of information that becomes available to the government concern you?

throwawaytampatoo,1,"Steve, thanks for the AMA.  

I'm one of the many I'm sure you've met in your life that have tried to get ideas out.  I developed and streamed the first TV show for the Internet back in 2001.  Yeah, way back then.  Try telling people back then that video was going to drive the Internet.

Then in 2006 I tried to develop the first MOOC. Some guy at MIT gets the credit but I had plenty of people involved back then.  

My question is how does someone of next to no means get that big break?  We all toil, endlessly, we all live our work but thousands of people like me never make it and pass into obscurity.

Hi Steve!

There's been a lot of talk (with good reason!) about security from what I've seen if this thread (in line at the DMV, so maybe I've a stilted view). I'm graduating with EE/CSE degrees this spring and ended up employed in hardware security - think back to the articles about Enclave extraction recently. While I think I've somewhat avoided it, it seems like there's an immense increase in the employment of EE folks in software-centric roles. Obviously we can expect such an increase as embedded technology rises, but it seems almost excessive. As someone who feels at least as at home with a soldering iron as he does a compiler, I've been pretty envious listening to professors of mine talk about the relatively massive diversity in hardware/computer hardware companies in the past. In other words, where we once had DEC, Intel, Texas, DG, Apple, and a pile more relying in tons of hardware expertise, it's focused down to just a relative few of those companies, and a much harder market to enter.

I didn't intend to just talk about it from a business point of view, so I hope it doesn't read that way. Hopefuly not too doomsday-y either, but i did write it in line for the dmv...

Basically just wondering what your thoughts are on where the role of the classic tinkerer/hacker is headed, and if you agree that the scrappy hardware-centric startups (for lack of a better term) are mostly a thing of the past - and if not, then why?

I often wonder if we'll someday live in a world where the lowest level programmers we will be able to find will be building relatively high level things on the shoulders of giants (Linus, K&R, you :), Stallman) and we won't have anyone left who can ""build from scratch"" as it were (solder a bunch of components together and burn a ROM with a custom OS).

4. Does Apple really ""innovate"" as much as they say? Touch ID, as example, was praised as a huge innovation, yet, the first Android phone which used a fingerprint sensor was released in 2011, AFAIK

5. Do you know why the custom keyboard API is so bad on iOS?

I admire your as a competent Engineer and a pioneer for a lot of important technologies. As a Computer Engineer, I've learned to appreciate the people behind the business and marketing end of a company.

My question: *Where does your philosophy on Free and Open Source Software and Hardware stand?* An extreme example of one such philosophy would be Richard Stallman's; He is morally opposed to using any hardware that inhibits the use of open-source software at _any_ level, including bootloaders. As a former engineer at Apple (known for closed-source and generally restrictive products)  _and_ having started as an informal hacker freely distributing blueprints of your work, how do you feel about the Open-Source/Permissive movement? Do you feel there is a ""right direction"" in this debate?

I recently got into the Apple II vintage computing hobby, and the more I have learned about both the Apple I and Apple II, the more in awe I am - the fact that you designed such an elegantly simple but capable set of hardware, and somehow managed to stay a delightful, well-adjusted human being. Kudos on that.

When the Apple IIGS came out, I thought it seemed much more interesting than the Mac of the same era. It had color, it was much more expandable, it was backwards-compatible with thousands of software titles, and was much more fun. Obviously Apple chose to double-down on the Mac and let the IIGS die - but do you think it would have been viable to continue to Apple II line? If so, where do you think it would have gone?"

As an old-school hardware guy who not only used and programmed but designed and built computers in the time where every bit and every cycle matters, what's your opinion on abstraction versus optimization?

Obviously the computing world we have today would not be practical to develop or maintain if everyone was still working as close to the metal as you had to in the homebrew days, but the fact that my wristwatch in 2016 has a quad-core 1.2GHz processor and more both RAM and storage than my first three computers combined seems like we might have gone a bit off the deep end.

On a less technical level, what technology has most surprised you by becoming available to ordinary consumers?  I mean the sort of thing that you thought would only exist in science fiction, or remain ""10 years away"" in labs.

Thanks for taking the time to do this and thanks for your contributions to the computing world.  My elementary school had Apple IIs and the BASIC environment on those showed me that I could make a computer do what I wanted.  That helped set the course for my life, even if ""what I wanted"" at that time was to make it print ""Fart"" on loop.

Issues start to emerge.  For instance I can make a pretty decent hackintosh with a nuk for about 150 bucks.  To buy an apple product that is similar it would cost around 2000 dollars.  

A new Apple iPhone has the same internals as a two year old samsung for half the price and doesn't have to use expensive proprietary software to use certain apps.  (Which are usually free on Android devices)

I just can't see apple continuing their success.  I know they have a lot of cash, but they are falling behind in every category."

Your company is very impressive but I feel that you've begun to stagnate and your thinking has grown inwards, either this or I don't see your company the way I see tesla or something similar, its as if you've gone silent.

I am a cs major and everywhere I go people are using MacBook, ipad, iphones, and even the Iwatch. And I almost feel like this is extrenous. They all say the same thing that it is better and you're not a real programmer if you're not using apple products. It kind of drives me nuts. Speaking purely off of hardware ""windows"" products are cheaper. I feel that the machine does not make the code. I have ubuntu on my laptop and win 10 (I want a new xp or just bring back xp) on my desktop. Soon to dual boot with ubuntu. And I code fine. I'm learning about algorithms just as much as the next person.

From here comes my small question: what happened the silver sharpie I lent you for signing stuff?  
I tried to ask around if you left it somewhere but nobody could answer, I was too shy to even dare to ask if you left it somewhere and I'm pretty sure that due to how timeframes worked and all, there was really no chance to recover it.

For the past 29 years, I have made a living in IT, as a programmer, a consultant, even a CTO for awhile back in the first internet bubble... All of that, all that I am today, is because of your desire to tinker with electronics in your garage.  So for myself, my wife and 2 wonderful sons, we all thank you for having a curiosity and an enthusiasm that created an industry.

Now that is out of the way, I feel greedy asking a question, but if there is one thing I want to know is if you are aware of the far reaching impact you have had on millions of lives like my family's?

I went and got to meet a whole different crowd of folk. It was great how you eventually ended up building the personal computer.

I was so amazed that you also were the creator of that Brick breaking game, all with no code, just transistors, resistors, etc. A game I used on my black and white Nokia at the time.

What I will never forget is chatting up with someone after your talk. Outside I was telling someone how I am trying to get into Linux.

My only gripe was lack of money to buy a new hard drive. The guy tells me to hold on, reaches in the trunk of his car and hands me an old 10 gig drive and told me to have at it.

Now I regularly manage servers, and I might of never been able to install Slackware on my pc at the time if I never went."

I work in tech, but have a background in psychology and arts. i sometimes look very deeply into things which may or may not have any meaning.

i was wondering if there are any spiritual forces or guides that you follow and if so, how did they help you (or you believe they helped you) in your inventions? i remember reading that Tesla for example had some interesting ideas on the universe.

computers have been used for so much good, and yet so much evil. i suppose someone could say this about the pen as well.

at the end of the day, these amazing devices whether synthetically made, still use real metals from Earth. the impact on the planet in the quest for more technology has been atrocious, and worker conditions sometimes poor. for example, chips made in Foxconn plants had such poor working conditions, apparently the company made employees sign a suicide waiver (if they committed suicide they would forfeit familial benefits).

at the end day is the Apple (or Sony or Toshiba or whoever) consumer who wants what they want without looking into the amount of work and side-effects (whether positive or negative) that occur in the process.

im curious as to how someone who originally invented the apple computer, like how does that make you feel? and im not trying to poke, honest question here. do you think it has been carried too far in the quest for the bottom line perhaps?

My question: why is it that Apple markets brand-new devices with two-years-obsolete hardware at what is today considered to be higher-than-premium prices? I understand that a great deal of effort goes into the UI, software and Architecture, and various cloud services, but this doesn't explain why consumers are being charged essentially modern day premium prices for, by all standards, what is essentially two year old specifications. 

&nbsp;

Also, While Apple has continued to produce high quality and attractive hardware, it seems that the greatest portion of Apple's halcyon days of visionary and paradigm-shifting inventions are behind them now, with most improvements being incremental rather than revolutionary.

But as there are fierce competitions in any areas of Information Technology, it gets harder to survive in the market.

	1. Do you think is it ever possible to balance between work and life?




	2. How does Apple work? Do they work based on design thinking? Isn't there any flaws? 



	3. When Apple was in the early stage, how did Apple work? was there any similarities to the current development style like Lean start-up or Agile?

Thank you very much for your reading

What do you think about technology becoming pliable to the touch? For example, a device that can change shape, and mesh perfectly to the shape of your hand. While being able to reverse these effects once letting go and returning back to it's original shape. This affects human comfort and I imagine one day this could possibly be a reality.

fuhry,1,"Steve, thanks so much for doing this. I know I'm late to the party and this will probably get buried but I'll take a shot.

I spend 3 nights a week working with kids who live in a particularly poor public housing project in Bridgeport, CT. The charity I work with runs a 90 minute after-school homework help program followed by a family style dinner. Some of the kids are severely struggling academically in a school system that does not have the resources to adequately teach them nor hold the struggling ones back. Last night I worked with an 8 year old in second grade who could not count higher than 29. I even got out the $100 bill I carry in my wallet for emergencies and asked him how much money it was and he couldn't tell me.

What, in your opinion, is the most effective way to combat this at a larger scale? Especially as an outsider to the school system. Have you seen patterns like this before in poorer urban settings?

Side note - I'm a senior software engineer at Datto and will probably be at DattoCon in Nashville this June, where you are scheduled to be our keynote speaker! If you have few moments to spare during the convention, I would love to spend some time talking about this more in depth with you. Datto was able to donate a fleet of used Alto devices to the city-run computer lab in the building where we hold our program so I've been able to expose the kids to Ubuntu a little, but there's a lot of foundational knowledge missing (such as reading and basic arithmetic) that is preventing these kids from having any way to really get exposure to technology."

I'm so glad I found this, I have a sincere question that I hope you'd be able to answer and you're the perfect person to do so.

I'm a lecturer at a college and I'm currently developing a learning guide for multimedia students. I would like to add in a short bit of accurate information regarding Macs and Windows PCs.

I've been doing research, but it's extremely difficult to find unbiased factual differences between the two platforms. I need the information to be current and I need to be able to cite it.

Personally over the past few years I have used both Windows and Mac and the differences are narrowing down a lot, it all comes down to preference now. But I'm hoping someone with your experience, not only as a co-founder at Apple, but also a industry savvy gadgeteer that you could give me some information to really help explain the similarities and differences between Mac OS X and Windows (Especially the newest versions of each).

So my question is:

In an unbiased fashion, based on your knowledge of the industry and your personal interest in various devices, what are the real technical differences between Mac OS X and Windows? And how will those differences impact a multimedia user in terms of coding and development, Photography work, 3D rendering, video editing and composites, animation, sound production and the Adobe Creative Suite?

If you could point out 3 advantages and disadvantages of each operating system, it would be immensely useful. Also, by citing you as a source I can be sure that the points are made from authority.

Kind regards

I've been 100% an apple user for almost a decade now, but recently I've seen some changes in some of the products that seem to be driven by other factors than providing the customers with the best product for them. For example, the rumored removal of the headphone jack on the iPhone 7. I know you can't comment on whether or not this is true until it comes out, but this will effectively prevent me from buying an iPhone again. I imagined that giving people no choice but to buy apple's (overpriced if you'll excuse me for saying) proprietary headphones and removing a universal connector would go against your original ideals in the early days, especially at homebrew, and it ignores the legacy of where the iPhone came from, which was the iPod, a music player.

ToothpasteWizard,1,Do you have any info on the mysterious Apple Car?
iCalculator,1,"I love the fact that the single most important part is your ideology, I also believe money should not be the end game, it is simply a facilitator.  Having worked in large corporates before going solo, one of the ethics that always got to me was the 'shareholder first' mentality.  The focus being finance generation rather than to meet / exceed an objective.

For me, Einstein got it right:
“Strive not to be a success, but rather be of value”

It’s a simpler challenge for me with a small business and a few employees (not that running any business is simple but comparatively).  I get to balance my desire for learning and getting out when the sun shines etc.  I also get to allow an environment where my guys do the same.  The business supports us in meeting our collective life aims.  Sure, I earn far less than I did and have days when I wonder what the hell I am doing but overall, I love it.

So, whatever right!  My question is, do you feel that Apple will be able to maintain its creative and flexible focus and avoid the corporate drive (that I feel eventually corrupts from the core idea that typically founded it)?  For me, the beauty of apple is that it opens peoples eyes, that innovation and strive to break the mould must always come ahead of ‘making a sale to please the shareholders’.

The life of Apple, and the two of you is really fascinating. I adore all of the amazing innovations that you could do, especially the Macintosh that you two built in your garage. I know that Jobs could be sorta mean at times, but has he ever raged to you about a product that you couldn't get right in his eyes? If so it would mean alot to me if you could reply.

Terrib1e,0,"Hi Steve. I don't know if you'll see this post or not but here goes it: I just finished your IWoz audiobook and it was really great and has really inspired me to continue my pursuit of being an engineer and inventor. Admittedly I'm a bit of a late starter. I'm 29 and originally went to school for neuroscience. Ever since I was a young boy I always took things apart and tried to learn how they work. I carry a small notebook around with me for when I think of a new business idea or invention I'd like to create. I've been teaching myself programming the last year or so and love that I can create things with minimum funding. I'd really like to go back to school for electrical engineering so that I have the foundation to make more things on my own. Hopefully I'll be able to do so once I can pay down my old student debt. I was wondering if you could direct me to some resources you find useful for learning and building things.  I'm trying to mirror your outlook on life and on engineering. I love how jovial, kind, and care free you seem while still possessing that passion for learning. I know it's a bit of a long shot and that youre constantly flooded with requests to talk but is there any way to contact you to ask you things outside of this ama? Thank you for the inspiration. I hope I can change the world even a fraction as much as you have.

TL;DR 
Thank you for inspiring me and for showing me a different way to live and view life and engineering.
